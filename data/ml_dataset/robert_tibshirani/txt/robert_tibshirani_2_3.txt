Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-death among women, where the clinicopathological features of tumors are used to
prognosticate and guide therapy. DNA copy number alterations (CNAs), which occur frequently in breast cancer and deﬁne
key pathogenetic events, are also potentially useful prognostic or predictive factors. Here, we report a genome-wide array-
based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) survey of CNAs in 89 breast tumors from a patient cohort with locally
advanced disease. Statistical analysis links distinct cytoband loci harboring CNAs to speciﬁc clinicopathological parameters,
including tumor grade, estrogen receptor status, presence of TP53 mutation, and overall survival. Notably, distinct spectra of
CNAs also underlie the different subtypes of breast cancer recently deﬁned by expression-proﬁling, implying these subtypes
develop along distinct genetic pathways. In addition, higher numbers of gains/losses are associated with the \basal-like" tumor
subtype, while high-level DNA ampliﬁcation is more frequent in \luminal-B" subtype tumors, suggesting also that distinct
mechanisms of genomic instability might underlie their pathogenesis. The identiﬁed CNAs may provide a basis for improved
patient prognostication, as well as a starting point to deﬁne important genes to further our understanding of the pathobiology
of breast cancer. This article contains Supplementary Material available at http://www.interscience.wiley.com/jpages/1045-

INTRODUCTION

Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related
morbidity and mortality among women. For patients
with breast cancer, clinical parameters and histopath-
ological features of the tumor are used to prognosti-
cate clinical outcome. Poor prognostic indicators for
localized breast cancer include metastasis to draining
axillary lymph nodes, large tumor size, high tumor
grade (i.e., poor differentiation, nuclear pleomor-
phism, and high mitotic index), ERBB2 (Her2/neu)
gene ampliﬁcation or protein overexpression, and
estrogen receptor (ER) negativity (for short term
prognosis) (Subramaniam and Isaacs, 2005). The
presence of such features is used to determine which
patients to treat with adjuvant chemotherapy follow-
ing surgical resection of their tumor. Additional mo-
lecular prognostic markers have been suggested and
await further evaluation (Gradishar, 2005; Subrama-
niam and Isaacs, 2005).

Histopathological

features of
tumors are also used to predict tumor response to
speciﬁc therapies, and thereby select optimal thera-
peutic regimens. For example, ER or progesterone
receptor (PR) positivity predicts response to hormo-
nal therapy with selective estrogen receptor modu-
lators (e.g. tamoxifen) (McGuire, 1978; EBCTCG,

2005). Ampliﬁcation/overexpression of ERBB2 pre-
dicts responsiveness to trastuzumab (a humanized
monoclonal antibody targeting Her2/neu) (Yeon and
Pegram, 2005) and also to dose-dependent use of
anthracyclines (Muss et al., 1994), likely due to co-
ampliﬁcation of TOP2A (Jarvinen et al., 2000).

More recently, molecular proﬁling methods have
been used to identify clinically-relevant tumor fea-
tures not previously appreciated by pathologists.
For example, discovery-based (i.e. unsupervised)
gene expression proﬁling studies have deﬁned sev-
eral distinct subtypes of breast cancer, including the
so-called \luminal epithelial-like" subtypes A and
B, a \basal epithelial-like" subtype, an ERBB2-
ampliﬁcation associated subtype, and a \normal
breast-like" subtype (Perou et al., 2000; Sorlie et al.,
2001). While luminal A and B subtypes are both
ER-positive, luminal B cases are associated with less
favorable outcome, as is the ERBB2 subtype and
particularly the ER-negative basal-like subtype
(Perou et al., 2000; Sorlie et al., 2001). More
directed (i.e. supervised) expression-proﬁling efforts
have also deﬁned gene signatures that predict dis-
ease recurrence and survival (van’t Veer et al., 2002;
Paik et al., 2004); it remains to be seen whether
such signatures yield beneﬁt over conventional
markers (Eden et al., 2004).

Genomic DNA copy number alterations (CNAs)
also provide potentially useful molecular markers
for breast cancer prognostication or prediction of
treatment response. Frequently observed CNAs
include gain of chromosomal regions 1q, 8q, 17q,
and 20q, and loss of 1p, 8p, 13q, and 17p (Knuutila
et al., 2000). Sites of localized high-level DNA
ampliﬁcation harboring known oncogenes include
7p12 (EGFR), 8q24 (MYC), 11q13 (CCND1), 12q14
(MDM2), 17q12 (ERBB2), 20q12 (AIB1), and 20q13
(ZNF217) [(Al-Kuraya et al., 2004), and references
therein]. Deletions with known tumor suppressor
include 13q12 (BRCA2), 17p13
genes
(TP53), and 17q21 (BRCA1). Cytogenetic studies
have identiﬁed gains on 8q, 17q12, and 20q13 to be
associated with poor overall survival (Isola et al.,
1995; Tanner et al., 1995; Ross and Fletcher, 1998).
DNA ampliﬁcation of ERBB2 at 17q12 also predicts
response to trastuzumab and high-dose anthracy-
clines. Since genomic DNA is more stable than
mRNA, and since CNAs deﬁne key genetic events
driving tumorigenesis, such genomic alterations are
potentially advantageous as prognostic/predictive
factors.

vanced primary breast tumors. We report the identiﬁ-
cation of distinct loci of CNA associated with differ-
ent clinicopathological
including tumor
grade, ER status, TP53 mutation, gene-expression
subtype, and overall survival. The identiﬁed CNAs
may provide a basis for improved patient prognostica-
tion, as well as a starting point to deﬁne important
genes contributing to breast cancer development and
progression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Breast Cancer Specimens

Breast tumor specimens were derived from 89
patients with locally advanced (T3/T4 and/or N2)
breast cancer receiving either doxorubicin or ﬂuo-
rouracil-mitomycin based neoadjuvant chemother-
apy (Geisler et al., 2001; 2003). Specimens were
snap-frozen immediately following surgical excision,
then stored at  808C. Genomic DNA was isolated
by chloroform/phenol extraction followed by etha-
nol precipitation (Nuclear Acid Extractor 340A;
Applied Biosystem) exactly as described (Geisler
et al., 2001). For 84 of the 89 cases, array CGH anal-
ysis was performed using genomic DNA from speci-
mens obtained prior to neoadjuvant therapy. ER sta-
tus was determined by ligand-binding assay, and
TP53 mutations were previously identiﬁed by tem-
poral
temperature gradient gel electrophoresis
(TTGE) followed by DNA sequencing as described
(Geisler et al., 2001). cDNA microarray-based gene
expression proﬁling data for 87 of the tumor speci-
mens were previously published (Sorlie et al., 2001;
2003), as well as their assignments to gene-expres-
sion subtypes using the nearest centroid method
(Sorlie et al., 2003).

Array CGH

cDNA microarrays were obtained from the Stan-
ford Functional Genomics Facility and included
39,632 human cDNAs, representing 22,488 mapped
human genes [18,040 UniGene clusters (Schuler,
1997), together with 4,112 additional mapped ESTs
not assigned UniGene IDs]. We performed array
CGH according to our published protocols (Pollack
et al., 1999; 2002). Brieﬂy, 4 lg of genomic DNA
from each tumor specimen was random-primer la-
beled with Cy5 and cohybridized to the microarray
along with 4 lg of Cy3-labeled normal female leuko-
cyte reference DNA from a single donor. Following
overnight hybridization and washing, arrays were
imaged using a GenePix 4000B scanner (Molecular
Devices). Fluorescence ratios were extracted using

PATTERNS OF DNA COPY NUMBER ALTERATION IN BREAST CANCER

1035

SpotReader software (Niles Scientiﬁc), and the data
uploaded into the Stanford Microarray Database
(Gollub et al., 2003) for storage, retrieval, and analy-
sis. Note, array CGH analysis had been previously
carried out on 29 of the 89 samples included in the
current study, using smaller (6,700 gene) cDNA
microarrays (Pollack et al., 1999; 2002).

Data Analysis

Background-subtracted ﬂuorescence ratios were
normalized for each array by setting the average ﬂuo-
rescence ratio for all array elements equal to 1. Genes
were considered reliably measured if
the ﬂuo-
rescence intensity for the Cy3 reference channel
was at least 1.4-fold above background. Map posi-
tions for arrayed cDNA clones were assigned using
the NCBI genome assembly, accessed through the
UCSC genome browser database (NCBI Build 35).
For genes represented by multiple arrayed cDNAs,
the average ﬂuorescence ratio was used. DNA gains
and losses were identiﬁed using the CLuster Along
Chromosomes method (CLAC; http://www-stat.
stanford.edu/wp57/CGH-Miner) (Wang, 2004). Brieﬂy,
the CLAC algorithm builds a hierarchical cluster-
style tree along each chromosome, such that neigh-
boring genes with positive and negative ratios
are separated into different clusters. DNA gains
and losses are then called signiﬁcant based on
the height and width of clusters, and a false discov-
ery rate is estimated by comparison to normal–nor-
mal hybridization data. To facilitate comparison
with clinicopathological parameters, the 22,000
mapped human genes were collapsed into 780 cyto-
bands (boundaries deﬁned by NCBI Build 35). For
each specimen, cytobands displaying gain or loss
were deﬁned as those harboring at least two genes
with gain or loss (respectively) called by CLAC,
and the magnitude of the CNA was deﬁned as the
average ﬂuorescence ratio for all genes residing
within the cytoband. Cytobands displaying high-
level DNA ampliﬁcation, here scored only as pres-
ent or absent, were deﬁned as those called by
CLAC and harboring at least two genes with tu-
mor/normal ratios greater than 3. Signiﬁcant associ-
ations between cytobands and clinicopathological
parameters were identiﬁed using the Signiﬁcance
Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) method (Tusher
et al., 2001), which is based on a modiﬁed t-statistic
(for two-class comparisons) or Cox score (for sur-
vival analysis), and uses random permutations of
class labels to estimate a false discovery rate
(FDR). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was per-
formed using WinSTAT (R. Finch software).

RESULTS

Array CGH Proﬁling of Primary Breast Carcinomas

To explore the relationship between CNAs and
clinicopathological parameters, we proﬁled CNAs
by array CGH in a series of 89 locally advanced
breast tumors [clinicopathological features sum-
marized in Table S1 (Supplementary material for
this article can be found at http://www.interscience.
wiley.com/jpages/1045-2257/suppmat)]. In this cohort,
high grade, ER negativity, and TP53 mutation each
showed the expected association with shorter overall
survival (P < 0.05, Kaplan–Meier analysis).

Array CGH was carried out using cDNA microar-
rays representing 22,000 human genes, thereby
providing on average a mapping resolution of less
than 70 kb (with mapping resolution paralleling
gene density for this gene-based array platform). We
observed numerous recurrent CNAs (summarized
in Fig. S1), the spectrum of which was consistent
with prior chromosome-based CGH studies (Knuu-
tila et al., 2000). The most frequent aberrations
included gains on 1q (35% of cases), 8q (35%), 11q
(26%), and 16p (14%), and losses on 4q (58%), 5q
(54%), 6q (43%), 8p (48%), and 14q (48%).

Speciﬁc CNAs Are Associated with
Clinicopathological Parameters

To discover associations between CNAs and path-
ological features, for each tumor we ﬁrst \collapsed"
CNA calls (i.e., gain, loss, or no change) for the
22,000 genes surveyed into CNA calls for the 780
cytoband loci represented by those genes (see Mate-
rials and Methods). The analysis of cytobands, which
integrates information across neighboring genes,
appeared more robust in preliminary analyses. We
also considered loci with high-level DNA ampliﬁca-
tion [ratios >3, corresponding to at least ﬁvefold
ampliﬁcation (Pollack et al., 1999)] separately from
those scored with gain, because they may be mecha-
nistically distinct (Lengauer et al., 1998).

Overall frequencies of gain/loss varied among
breast
tumors with different clinicopathological
features (Table 1). In particular, gains/losses were
more frequent (borderline-signiﬁcant) in ER-nega-
tive tumors (P ¼ 0.06, Student’s t test), and high-
level DNA ampliﬁcations were more common
(strong trend) in high-grade (P ¼ 0.08) and TP53-
mutant (P ¼ 0.13) tumors.
To identify associations between speciﬁc CNAs
and pathological parameters, we used the SAM
method (Tusher et al., 2001), which corrects for
multiple hypothesis (loci) testing in determining
statistical signiﬁcance (see Materials and Methods).

Since CNAs are known to often span cytobands, the
ﬁnding of two or more adjacent cytobands associated
with a particular
clinicopathological parameter
(emphasized in the results below) further increased
our conﬁdence in the results (as being biologically
sensible), which are summarized in Figure 1. We
identiﬁed several CNAs associated with tumor grade,
including loss at 3p14, 4q31-q35, and 5q13-q23 in
high-grade tumors. We also found CNAs associated
with ER status, where ER-negative tumors exhibited
more frequent loss at 5q11-q35 and 12q14-23, and
gain at 6p21-p25 and 7p12. Additionally, we identi-
ﬁed loci associated with TP53 mutation status,
including gain at 1q21-q32 with wild-type TP53 and
loss at 5q14-q23 with mutant TP53.

To deﬁne associations between CNAs and clini-
cal outcome, we performed survival analysis using
the SAM method (Fig. 1). We identiﬁed loss at
6q22-q23 and 13q12-q13 to be associated with
favorable outcome, while gain at 7p11-p14, 13q12-
q13, and 21q22 were associated with unfavorable
overall survival. We also identiﬁed high-level DNA
ampliﬁcations associated with unfavorable out-
come, including at 6q22, 15q23, 17q12-q21, and
20q13.

Distinct CNAs Are Associated with
Gene-Expression Subtypes

Previous DNA microarray studies had deﬁned
clinically-relevant breast cancer subtypes based on
distinct patterns of gene expression,
including
luminal epithelial-like subtypes A and B, a basal
epithelial-like subtype, and an ERBB2-ampliﬁca-
tion associated subtype (Perou et al., 2000; Sorlie
et al., 2001). Each of the breast tumors in our study
had been previously assigned to a gene-expression
subtype, by ﬁnding the best match of its expres-
sion proﬁle to the published average proﬁle of each
of the subtypes (Sorlie et al., 2003). To determine
whether different gene-expression subtypes were
associated with distinct CNAs, we used the two-

the online issue, which is available at www.interscience.wiley.com.]

As expected, ERBB2 subtype tumors, character-
ized by the ampliﬁcation and resultant overexpression
of ERBB2 and its neighbors (Perou et al., 2000),
exhibited more frequent ampliﬁcation at 17q12-q21
(harboring ERBB2). Luminal-A group tumors were
associated with gain at 1q12-q41 and 16p12-p13.
Luminal B tumors exhibited more frequent loss at
3q12, gain at 8q11-q24 and 20q13, and high-level
ampliﬁcation at 7p22, 8q11-24, 19q13, and 20q13.
CNAs associated with basal-like subtype tumors
included loss at 3q12, 4p15-p32, 4q31-q35, 5q11-q31,
and 14q22-q23, and gain at 1q12-q41, 6p12-p25, 7q22-
q36, 10p12-p15, 17q25, and 21q22. Only 2 of the 87
cases (for which gene-expression data were available)
were assigned to the normal breast-like subtype, pre-
cluding a meaningful analysis of this subgroup.

Interestingly, overall frequencies of gain/loss and
high-level ampliﬁcation also varied among breast tu-
mor subtypes (Table 1). In particular, gains/losses
were more frequent in basal-like tumors (P ¼ 0.02;
compared to ERBB2-associated tumors) and less
common in ERBB2-associated tumors (P ¼ 0.02;
compared to luminal-A or basal-like tumors). High-
level DNA ampliﬁcations were more frequent in
luminal-B tumors, compared to luminal-A or
ERBB2-associated tumors (P < 0.001), or to basal-
like tumors (P < 0.05).

DISCUSSION

The main objective of our study was to explore
associations between array CGH-detected CNAs
and clinicopathological parameters in breast can-

by the previous identiﬁcation of some of the same
associations by cytogenetic and molecular meth-
ods. In a chromosome-based CGH study of inva-
sive breast tumors (Richard et al., 2000), loss on 5q
was also found among the changes more frequent
in high-grade tumors, as were gain on 2p and 6p
and loss on 5q and 12q in ER-negative tumors.
More recently, a BAC array-based CGH study of
breast cancer (Loo et al., 2004) also identiﬁed gain
on 1q and loss on 5q among the changes more fre-
quent in ER-negative tumors. While in both these
studies there were discordant loci as well, this may
in part reﬂect differences in methodology or patient
cohorts. Also in concordance with our study, a quan-
titative analysis of chromosome CGH data previ-
ously linked 5q15-q21 deletion to TP53 mutation
(Jain et al., 2001).

While CNAs associated with tumor grade, ER
status, and TP53 mutation have the potential to
inform pathobiology, the identiﬁcation of CNAs
associated with clinical outcome might be more
directly beneﬁcial in improved patient prognostica-
tion. We identiﬁed several loci of CNA correlated
with unfavorable overall survival,
including the
previously reported ampliﬁed loci 17q12 (ERBB2)
(Ross and Fletcher, 1998) and 20q13 (ZNF217)
(Tanner et al., 1995). Of the novel loci identiﬁed,
the 7p11.2 gain harbors EGFR, encoding an onco-
genic receptor tyrosine kinase and target for molec-
ularly-directed therapies (Agrawal et al., 2005);
although expression of EGFR has been evaluated
there has been no consensus on its prognostic util-
ity (Rampaul et al., 2005). Clearly additional stud-
ies on independent patient cohorts (and including
earlier stages of breast cancer) are warranted to val-
idate the prognostic utility of identiﬁed CNAs, and
to assess whether they might provide an improve-
ment over currently used prognostic factors.

An important ﬁnding of our study was the associ-
ation between selected CNAs and the different
gene-expression subtypes of breast cancer. While
most associations are novel, a recent SNP array-
based loss of heterozygosity (LOH) study of breast
cancer also reported LOH on 4p and 5q to be asso-
ciated with breast tumors with \basal-like" expres-
sion proﬁles (Wang et al., 2004). Another study also
identiﬁed X-chromosomal abnormalities speciﬁc to
basal-like breast tumors, but most reﬂected X-
chromosome isodisomy with no net DNA gain or
loss that would be detectable by CGH (Richardson
et al., 2006). Notably, that the gene-expression
subtypes in our study exhibited distinct spectra
of CNAs suggests they develop along different
genetic pathways. The constellation of genetic

cer. By SAM analysis of array CGH data, we dis-
covered associations between CNAs at various
cytoband loci and clinicopathological parameters,
including tumor grade, ER status, TP53 mutation,
gene-expression tumor subtype, and overall sur-
vival. Although most of the observed associations
are novel, the validity of our ﬁndings is supported

alterations might directly specify the gene-expres-
sion phenotype, as 17q12 (ERBB2) ampliﬁcation
appears to do so for the ERBB2-ampliﬁcation asso-
ciated subtype. Alternatively, speciﬁc breast epi-
thelial cell types or progenitors (e.g., with basal or
luminal characteristics) might be more susceptible
to transformation via a particular constellation of
genetic changes.

Several of the subtype-speciﬁc CNAs are notewor-
thy. For example, gain on 8q was more frequent in
luminal-B subtype tumors, which are a subset of ER-
positive tumors characterized by higher proliferation
rates and associated unfavorable outcomes. Among
the genes on 8q, the MYC oncogene plays a key role
in promoting cell proliferation (Adhikary and Eilers,
2005), and this association may in part explain the
higher proliferation rates of these tumors. Within the
6p21-p25 gain associated with ER-negative and ba-
sal-like tumors reside several candidate oncogenes,
including DEK, E2F3, NOTCH4, PIM1, and CCND3.
Another prominent ﬁnding was the loss on 5q
associated with high grade, ER-negative, TP53-mu-
tant, and basal-like breast tumors. Since this constel-
lation of clinicopathological features often occurs to-
gether (Sorlie et al., 2001), it is not possible to infer
the direct causal associations, e.g., whether a 5q
TSG(s) directly cooperates with TP53 mutation to
effect tumorigenesis, or whether loss on 5q is more
generally associated with aggressive tumor character-
istics. Intriguingly, basal-like breast tumors share fea-
tures with breast tumors arising in BRCA1 mutation
carriers, which are also typically high-grade, ER-neg-
ative, and HER2-negative (Johannsson et al., 1997),
and exhibit in common gene-expression patterns
(Sorlie et al., 2003) and expression of basal cytokera-
tins (Foulkes et al., 2003). In this regard, it is of inter-
est that BRCA1-associated tumors also exhibit fre-
quent loss of 5q (Tirkkonen et al., 1997), and that a
BRCA1-modiﬁer locus for hereditary breast cancer
penetrance has been mapped to 5q (Nathanson
et al., 2002). Several interesting tumor suppressor
including RAD17,
gene candidates map to 5q,
XRCC4, APC, and RAD50.

It is also notable that the different breast cancer
gene-expression subtypes exhibited different over-
all frequencies of CNA, with gain/loss more com-
mon in basal-like tumors and less so in ERBB2-
associated tumors, and high-level ampliﬁcation
more frequent in luminal-B tumors. This ﬁnding
suggests the possibility that different mechanisms
of genomic instability underlie the pathogenesis of
the different breast tumor subtypes, and may con-
tribute to their distinct biological and clinical
behaviors.

In summary, we have here deﬁned array-CGH
detected CNAs associated with distinct clinicopatho-
logical features, including clinical outcome and gene-
expression subtypes. Our ﬁndings support the poten-
tial utility of CNA-based prognostication in breast
cancer. The discovery of CNAs associated with clini-
copathological features, including tumor grade, ER
status, TP53 mutation, gene-expression subtype, and
overall survival, also provides a starting point to iden-
tify the underlying genes and further our understand-
ing of the pathobiology of breast cancer.
