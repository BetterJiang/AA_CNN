1. Introduction

DNA  microarray  technology  has  been  used  successfully  to  detect  the
expression of many thousands of genes, to detect DNA polymorphisms, and
to map genomic DNA clones (14). It permits quantitative analysis of RNAs
transcribed from both known and unknown genes and allows one to compare
gene expression patterns in normal and pathological cells and tissues (5,6).

DNA microarrays are created using a robot to spot cDNA or oligonucleotide
samples on a solid substrate, usually a glass microscope slide, at high densities.
The sizes of spots printed in different laboratories range from 75 to 150 m
in diameter. The spacing between spots on an array is usually 100200 m.
Microarrays with as many as 50,000 spots can be easily fabricated on standard
25 mm  75 mm glass microscope slides.

Two  types  of  spotted  DNA  microarrays  are  in  common  use:  cDNA  and
synthetic  oligonucleotide  arrays  (7,8).  The  surface  onto  which  the  DNA  is
spotted is critically important. The ideal surface immobilizes the target DNAs,
and is compatible with stringent probe hybridization and wash conditions (9).
Glass has many advantages as such a support. DNA can be covalently attached
to  treated  glass  surfaces,  and  glass  is  durable  enough  to  tolerate  exposure
to  elevated  temperatures  and  high-ionic-strength  solutions.  In  addition,  it  is
nonporous, so hybridization volumes can be kept to a minimum, enhancing the
kinetics of annealing probes to targets. Finally, glass allows probes labeled with
two or more  uors to be used, unlike nylon membranes, which are typically
probed with one radiolabeled probe at a time.

3. Methods
3.1. Selection and Preparation of cDNA Clones
3.1.1. Selection of Clones

Microarrays are usually made with DNA fragments that have been ampli ed
by  PCR  from  plasmid  samples  or  directly  from  chromosomal  DNA.  The
sizes of the PCR products on our arrays range from 0.5 to 2 kb. They attach
well to the glass surface. The amount of DNA deposited per spot depends on
the pins chosen for printing, but elements with 250 pg to 1 ng of DNA (up to
9  108 molecules) give ample signals.

Many  of  the  cDNA  clones  that  have  been  arrayed  by  laboratories  in  the
public domain have come from the Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes
and Expression (IMAGE) Consortium set. Five million human IMAGE clones
have  been  collected  and  are  available  from  Invitrogen/Research  Genetics
(www.resgen.com/products/IMAGEClones.php3).  Sequence-veri ed  cDNA
clones from humans, mice, and rats are also available from Invitrogen/Research
Genetics.

cDNA clones can also be obtained from other sources. The 15,000 National
Institute of Aging (NIA) mouse cDNA set has been distributed to many aca-
demic centers (http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/cDNA/15k/hsc.html). Other mouse
cDNA  collections  include  the  Brain  Molecular Anatomy  Project  (BMAP)
(http://brainest.eng.uiowa.edu),  and  RIKEN  (http://genome.rtc.riken.go.jp)
clone sets. In preparing our arrays, we have used the NIA and BMAP collec-
tions and are in the process of sequencing the 5 ends of the 41,000 clones in
the combined set in collaboration with scientists at the Korea Research Institute
of Bioscience and Biotechnology. Note that most cDNA collections suffer from
some gridding errors and well-to-well cross contamination.

3.1.2. Preparation of Clones

Preparing DNA for spotting involves making plasmid minipreps, amplifying
their inserts, and cleaning up the PCR products. Most IMAGE clones are in
standard cloning vectors, and the inserts can be ampli ed with modi ed M13
primers. The sequences of the forward (M13F) and reverse (M13R) primers
used  are  5-GTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG-3  and  5-CACACAGGAAA
CAGCTATG-3, respectively. A variety of methods are available for purifying
cDNA  samples.  We  use  QIAprep  96  Turbo  Miniprep  kits  and  a  Qiagen
BioRobot  8000  (Qiagen)  for  plasmid  isolations  but  cheaper,  semiautomated
techniques  can  be  used  as  well. We  PCR  DNAs  with  a  Tetrad  MultiCycler
(MJ Research, Incline Village, NV) and purify the products with Multiscreen
 ltration plates (Millipore).

3.1.3. Puri cation of Plasmid

1.  Culture the bacterial clones overnight in 1.3 mL of LuriaBertani (LB) medium
containing  100  g/mL  of  carbenicillin  at  37C,  shaking  them  at  300  rpm  in
96-well  at-bottomed blocks.

2.  Harvest the bacteria by centrifuging the blocks for 5 min at 1500g in an Eppendorf
centrifuge 5810R (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). Remove the LB by inverting the
block. The cell pellets can be stored at 20C.

3.  Prepare cDNA using the BioRobot 8000, or follow the Qiagen QIAprep 96 Turbo

Miniprep kit protocol for manual extraction.

4.  Elute the DNA with 100 L of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) included in
the QIAprep 96 Turbo Miniprep kit. The plasmid DNA yield should be 510 g
per prep.

3.1.4. PCR Ampli cation

1.  Dilute the plasmid solution 110 with 1X TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM

EDTA).

2.  For each 96-well plate to be ampli ed, prepare a PCR reaction mixture containing
the following ingredients: 1000 L of 10X PCR buffer (Invitrogen), 20 L each
of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (100 mM each; Amersham Pharmacia), 5 L
each of M13F and M13R (1 mM each; Operon), 100 L of Taq DNA polymerase
(5 U/L; Invitrogen), and 8800 L of ddH2O.

3.  Add 100 L of PCR reaction mix to each well of a PCR CyclePlate (Robbins)
plus 5 L of diluted plasmid template. Seal the wells with CycleSeal PCR plate
sealer (Robbins). (Prepare two plates for ampli cation from each original source
plate to give a  nal volume of 200 L of each product.)

4.  Use the following PCR conditions: 96C for 2 min; 30 cycles at 94C for 30 s,
55C  for  30  s,  72C  for  1  min  30  s;  72C  for  5  min;  and  cool  to  ambient
temperature.

4                                                                           Xiang and Brownstein

5.  Analyze 2 L of each product on 2% agarose gels. We use an Owl Millipede
A6 gel system (Portsmouth, NH) with eight 50-tooth combs. This allows us to
run 384 samples per gel.

3.1.5. Cleanup of PCR Product

1.  Transfer  the  PCR  products  from  the  two  duplicate  PCR  CyclePates  to  one

Millipore Multiscreen PCR plate using the Qiagen BioRobot 8000.

2.  Place  the  Multiscreen  plate  on  a  vacuum  manifold. Apply  the  vacuum  to  dry

the plate.

3.  Add 100 L of ddH2O to each well.
4.  Shake the plate for 30 min at 300 rpm.
5.  Transfer the puri ed PCR products to a 96-well plate.
6.  Store the PCR products in a 20C freezer.

3.2. Creating cDNA Microarrays (see Note 1)

Robots are routinely used to apply DNA samples to glass microscope slides.
The  slides  are  treated  with  poly-L-lysine  or  other  chemical  coatings.  Some
investigators  irradiate  the  printed  arrays  with  UV  light.  Slides  coated  with
poly-L-lysine have a positively charged surface, however, and the negatively
charged DNA molecules bind quite tightly without crosslinking. Finally, the
hydrophobic character of the glass surface minimizes spreading of the printed
spots. Poly-L-lysine-coated slides are inexpensive to make, and we have found
that they work quite well.

About  1  nL  of  PCR  product  is  spotted  per  element.  Many  printers  are
commercially available. Alternatively, one can be built in-house (for detailed
instructions, visit http://cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown/mguide/index.html). After
the arrays are printed, residual amines are blocked with succinic anhydride (see
http://cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown/mguide/index.html).

3.2.1. Coating Slides with Poly-L-lysine

1.  Prepare cleaning solution by dissolving 100 g of NaOH in 400 mL of ddH2O.

Add 600 mL of absolute ethanol and stir until the solution clears.

2.  Place  Gold  Seal  microscope  slides  (Becton  Dickinson)  into  30  stainless-steel
slide racks (Wheaton, Millville, NJ). Place the racks in a glass tank with 500 mL
of cleaning solution. Work with four racks (120 slides in total) at a time.

3.  Shake at 60 rpm for 2 h.
4.  Wash with ddH2O four times, 3 min for each wash.
5.  Make a poly-L-lysine solution by mixing 80 mL of 0.1% (w/v) poly-L-lysine with

80 mL of phosphate-buffered saline and 640 mL of ddH2O.

6.  Transfer two racks into one plastic tray with 400 mL of coating solution.
7.  Shake at 60 rpm for 1 h.

8.  Rinse the slides three times with ddH2O.
9.  Dry  the  slides  by  placing  them  in  racks  (Shandon  Lipshaw,  Pittsburgh,  PA)
and spinning them at 130g for 5 min in a Sorvall Super T21 centrifuge with an
ST-H750 swinging bucket rotor. Place one slide rack in each bucket.

10.  Store the slides in plastic storage boxes and age them for 2 wk before printing

DNA on them.

3.2.2. Spotting DNA on Coated Slides

We  use  the  following  parameters  to  print  11,136  element  arrays  with
an  OmniGrid  robot  having  a  Server Arm  (GeneMachines,  San  Carlos,  CA):
4    4  SMP3  pins  (TeleChem,  Sunnyvale,  CA),  160    160  M  spacing,
27  26 spots in each subarray, single dot per sample. We use the following
printing parameters: velocity of 13.75 cm/s, acceleration of 20 cm/s2, decelera-
tion of 20 cm/s2. We print two identical arrays on each slide.

1.  Adjust the relative humidity of the arrayer chamber to 4555% and the tempera-

ture to 22C.

2.  Dilute the puri ed PCR products 11 with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma)
(see Note 2). Transfer 10-L aliquots of the samples to Genetix 384-well plates
(Genetix).

3.  Load the plates into the cassette of the Server Arm. Three such cassettes hold
36 plates. Reload the cassettes in midrun if more than 36 plates of samples are
to be printed. It takes about 24 h to print 100 slides with 2  11,136 elements
on them.

4.  Label the slides. Examine the  rst slide in the series under a microscope. Mark
the four corners of the array (or the separate arrays if there are more than one on
the slide) with a scribe. Use this indexed slide to draw a template on a second
microscope  slide  showing  where  the  cover  slip  should  be  placed  during  the
hybridization step. Remove the remaining slides from the arrayer and store them
in a plastic box.

3.2.3. Postprocessing

We  often  postprocess  our  arrays  after  storing  them  for  several  days. This
may not be necessary as others have argued, but it is sometimes convenient.
Many workers recommend UV crosslinking the DNA to the slide surface by
exposing the arrays to 450 mJ of UV irradiation in a Stratalinker (Stratagene,
La  Jolla,  CA). As  noted,  this  step  is  optional,  and  we  have  not  found  it  to
be critical.

1.  Insert 30 slides into a stainless steel rack and place each rack in a small glass

tank.

2.  In a chemical fume hood, dissolve 6 g of succinic anhydride (Sigma) in 325 mL

of 1-methy-2-pyrrolidinone (Sigma) in a glass beaker by stirring.

6                                                                           Xiang and Brownstein

3.  Add 25 mL of 1 M sodium borate buffer (pH 8.0) to the beaker as soon as the

succinic anhydride is dissolved.

4.  Rapidly pour the solution into the glass tank.
5.  Place  the  glass  tank  on  a  platform  shaker  and  shake  at  60  rpm  for  20  min  in
the hood. While the slides are incubating on the shaker, prepare a boiling water
bath.

6.  Transfer  the  slides  to  a  container  with  0.1%  sodium  dodecyl  sulfate  solution.

Shake at 60 rpm for 3 min.

7.  Wash the slides with ddH2O for 2 min. Repeat the wash two more times.
8.  Place the slides in the boiling water bath. Turn off the heat immediately after
submerging the slides in the water. Denature the DNA for 2 min in the water
bath.

9.  Transfer the slides to a container with 100% ethanol and incubate for 4 min.
10.  Dry the slides in a centrifuge at 130g for 5 min (see Subheading 3.2.1., step 9)
and  store  them  in  a  clean  plastic  box. The  slides  are  now  ready  to  be  probed
(see Note 3).

4. Notes
1.  The methods for printing slides described in this chapter are somewhat tedious,

but they are robust and inexpensive.

2.  We  recommend  dissolving  the  DNAs  to  be  printed  in  50%  DMSO  instead  of
aqueous  buffers  because  this  is  a  simple  solution  to  the  problem  of  sample
evaporation during long printing runs (10).

3.  The  probe-labeling  technique  that  we  describe  in  Chapter  4  works  well  with

slides prepared according to the protocols we have given.
