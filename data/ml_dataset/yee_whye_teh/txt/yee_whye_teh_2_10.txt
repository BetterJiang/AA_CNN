We introduce a new Bayesian model for hierarchical clustering based on a prior
over trees called Kingman’s coalescent. We develop novel greedy and sequential
Monte Carlo inferences which operate in a bottom-up agglomerative fashion. We
show experimentally the superiority of our algorithms over others, and demon-
strate our approach in document clustering and phylolinguistics.

Introduction

Hierarchically structured data abound across a wide variety of domains. It is thus not surprising that
hierarchical clustering is a traditional mainstay of machine learning [1]. The dominant approach to
hierarchical clustering is agglomerative: start with one cluster per datum, and greedily merge pairs
until a single cluster remains. Such algorithms are efﬁcient and easy to implement. Their primary
limitations—a lack of predictive semantics and a coherent mechanism to deal with missing data—
can be addressed by probabilistic models that handle partially observed data, quantify goodness-of-
ﬁt, predict on new data, and integrate within more complex models, all in a principled fashion.
Currently there are two main approaches to probabilistic models for hierarchical clustering. The
ﬁrst takes a direct Bayesian approach by deﬁning a prior over trees followed by a distribution over
data points conditioned on a tree [2, 3, 4, 5]. MCMC sampling is then used to obtain trees from
their posterior distribution given observations. This approach has the advantages and disadvantages
of most Bayesian models: averaging over sampled trees can improve predictive capabilities, give
conﬁdence estimates for conclusions drawn from the hierarchy, and share statistical strength across
the model; but it is also computationally demanding and complex to implement. As a result such
models have not found widespread use. [2] has the additional advantage that the distribution induced
on the data points is exchangeable, so the model can be coherently extended to new data. The
second approach uses a ﬂat mixture model as the underlying probabilistic model and structures the
posterior hierarchically [6, 7]. This approach uses an agglomerative procedure to ﬁnd the tree giving
the best posterior approximation, mirroring traditional agglomerative clustering techniques closely
and giving efﬁcient and easy to implement algorithms. However because the underlying model has
no hierarchical structure, there is no sharing of information across the tree.
We propose a novel class of Bayesian hierarchical clustering models and associated inference algo-
rithms combining the advantages of both probabilistic approaches above. 1) We deﬁne a prior and
compute the posterior over trees, thus reaping the beneﬁts of a fully Bayesian approach; 2) the dis-
tribution over data is hierarchically structured allowing for sharing of statistical strength; 3) we have
efﬁcient and easy to implement inference algorithms that construct trees agglomeratively; and 4) the
induced distribution over data points is exchangeable. Our model is based on an exchangeable distri-
bution over trees called Kingman’s coalescent [8, 9]. Kingman’s coalescent is a standard model from
population genetics for the genealogy of a set of individuals. It is obtained by tracing the genealogy
backwards in time, noting when lineages coalesce together. We review Kingman’s coalescent in
Section 2. Our own contribution is in using it as a prior over trees in a hierarchical clustering model
(Section 3) and in developing novel inference procedures for this model (Section 4).

2 Kingman’s coalescent

Kingman’s coalescent is a standard model in population genetics describing the common genealogy
(ancestral tree) of a set of individuals [8, 9]. In its full form it is a distribution over the genealogy of
a countably inﬁnite set of individuals. Like other nonparametric models (e.g. Gaussian and Dirich-
let processes), Kingman’s coalescent is most easily described and understood in terms of its ﬁnite
dimensional marginal distributions over the genealogies of n individuals, called n-coalescents. We
obtain Kingman’s coalescent as n→∞.
Consider the genealogy of n individuals alive at the present time t = 0. We can trace their ancestry
backwards in time to the distant past t =−∞. Assume each individual has one parent (in genetics,
haploid organisms), and therefore genealogies of [n] = {1, ..., n} form a directed forest. In general,
at time t≤0, there are m (1≤ m≤ n) ancestors alive. Identify these ancestors with their correspond-
ing sets ρ1, ..., ρm of descendants (we will make this identiﬁcation throughout the paper). Note that
π(t) = {ρ1, ..., ρm} form a partition of [n], and interpret t(cid:55)→ π(t) as a function from (−∞, 0] to the
set of partitions of [n]. This function is piecewise constant, left-continuous, monotonic (s≤ t implies
that π(t) is a reﬁnement of π(s)), and π(0)={{1}, ...,{n}} (see Figure 1a). Further, π completely
and succinctly characterizes the genealogy; we shall henceforth refer to π as the genealogy of [n].
Kingman’s n-coalescent is simply a distribution over genealogies of [n], or equivalently, over the
space of partition-valued functions like π. More speciﬁcally, the n-coalescent is a continuous-time,
partition-valued, Markov process, which starts at {{1}, ...,{n}} at present time t = 0, and evolves
backwards in time, merging (coalescing) lineages until only one is left. To describe the Markov
process in its entirety, it is sufﬁcient to describe the jump process (i.e. the embedded, discrete-time,
Markov chain over partitions) and the distribution over coalescent times. Both are straightforward
and their simplicity is part of the appeal of Kingman’s coalescent. Let ρli, ρri be the ith pair of
lineages to coalesce, tn−1 < · · · < t1 < t0 = 0 be the coalescent times and δi = ti−1 − ti > 0
be the duration between adjacent events (see Figure 1a). Under the n-coalescent, every pair of
lineages merges independently with rate 1. Thus the ﬁrst pair amongst m lineages merge with rate

(cid:1)(cid:1) independently, the pair ρli, ρri is chosen from among

2
those right after time ti, and with probability one a random draw from the n-coalescent is a binary
tree with a single root at t=−∞ and the n individuals at time t=0. The genealogy is given as:

Combining the probabilities of the durations and choices of lineages, the probability of π is simply:

The n-coalescent has some interesting statistical properties [8, 9]. The marginal distribution over
tree topologies is uniform and independent of the coalescent times. Secondly, it is inﬁnitely ex-
changeable: given a genealogy drawn from an n-coalescent, the genealogy of any m contemporary
individuals alive at time t ≤ 0 embedded within the genealogy is a draw from the m-coalescent.
Thus, taking n → ∞, there is a distribution over genealogies of a countably inﬁnite population
for which the marginal distribution of the genealogy of any n individuals gives the n-coalescent.
Kingman called this the coalescent.

We take a Bayesian approach to hierarchical clustering, placing a coalescent prior on the latent tree
and modeling observed data with a Markov process evolving forward in time along the tree. We will
alter our terminology from genealogy to tree, from n individuals at present time to n observed data
points, and from individuals on the genealogy to latent variables on the tree-structured distribution.
Let x1, ..., xn be n observed data at the leaves of a tree π drawn from the n-coalescent. π has n − 1
coalescent points, the ith occuring when ρli and ρri merge at time ti to form ρi = ρli ∪ ρri. Let tli
and tri be the times at which ρli and ρri are themselves formed.
We construct a continuous-time Markov process evolving along the tree from the past to the present,
branching independently at each coalescent point until we reach time 0, where the n Markov pro-
cesses induce a distribution over the n data points. The joint distribution respects the conditional
independences implied by the structure of the directed tree. Let yρi be a latent variable that takes on
the value of the Markov process at ρi just before it branches (see Figure 1a). Let y{i} = xi at leaf i.
To complete the description of the likelihood model, let q(z) be the initial distribution of the Markov
process at time t = −∞, and kst(x, y) be the transition probability from state x at time s to state y
at time t. This Markov process need be neither stationary nor ergodic. Marginalizing over paths of
the Markov process, the joint probability over the latent variables and the observations is:

p(x, y, z|π) = q(z)k−∞ tn−1(z, yρn−1)(cid:81)n−1

i=1 ktitli(yρi, yρli)ktitri(yρi, yρri)

(3)
Notice that the marginal distributions at each observation p(xi|π) are identical and given by the
Markov process at time 0. However, they are not independent: they share the same sample path down
the Markov process until they split. In fact the amount of dependence between two observations is
a function of the time at which the observations coalesce in the past. A more recent coalescent time
implies larger dependence. The overall distribution induced on the observations p(x) inherits the
inﬁnite exchangeability of the n-coalescent. We considered a brownian diffusion (see Figures 1(b,c))
and a simple independent sites mutation process on multinomial vectors (Section 4.3).

4 Agglomerative sequential Monte Carlo and greedy inference

We develop two classes of efﬁcient and easily implementable inference algorithms for our hierar-
chical clustering model based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and greedy schemes respectively.
In both classes, the latent variables are integrated out, and the trees are constructed in a bottom-up
fashion. The full tree π can be expressed as a series of n − 1 coalescent events, ordered backwards
in time. The ith coalescent event involves the merging of the two subtrees with leaves ρli and ρri
and occurs at a time δi before the previous coalescent event. Let θi = {δj, ρlj, ρrj for j ≤ i} denote
the ﬁrst i coalescent events. θn−1 is equivalent to π and we shall use them interchangeably.
We assume that the form of the Markov process is such that the latent variables {yρi}n−1
i=1 and z can
be efﬁciently integrated out using an upward pass of belief propagation on the tree. Let Mρi(y) be
the message passed from yρi to its parent; M{i}(y) = δxi(y) is point mass at xi for leaf i. Mρi(y)
is proportional to the likelihood of the observations at the leaves below coalescent event i, given that
yρi = y. Belief propagation computes the messages recursively up the tree; for i = 1, ..., n − 1:

Zρi(x, θi) is a normalization constant introduced to avoid numerical problems. The choice of Z
does not affect the probability of x, but does impact the accuracy and efﬁciency of our inference

algorithms. We found that Zρi(x, θi) =(cid:82) q(y)Mρi(y) dy worked well. At the root, we have:

Mρi(y) = Z−1

ρi (x, θi)(cid:81)

(cid:82) ktitbi(y, yb)Mρbi(yb) dyb
Z−∞(x, θn−1) =(cid:82) q(z)k−∞ tn−1(z, y)Mρn−1(y) dy dz

b=l,r

The marginal probability p(x|π) is now given by the product of normalization constants:

p(x|π) = Z−∞(x, θn−1)(cid:81)n−1

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

Multiplying in the prior (2) over π, we get the joint probability for the tree π and observations x:

p(x, π) = Z−∞(x, θn−1)(cid:81)n−1

(cid:1)δi

(cid:1) Zρi(x, θi)

i=1 Zρi(x, θi)

Our inference algorithms are based upon (7). Note that each term Zρi(x, θi) can be interpreted as a
1. In general, for each i, we choose a duration δi
local likelihood term for coalescing the pair ρli, ρri
and a pair of subtrees ρli, ρri to coalesce. This choice is based upon the ith term in (7), interpreted
as the product of a local prior and a local likelihood for choosing δi, ρli and ρri given θi−1.

This approach requires the fewest particles, but is the most computationally expensive due to the
integral for each pair. Fortunately, for the case of Brownian diffusion process described below, these
integrals are tractable and related to generalized inverse Gaussian distributions.

4.2 Greedy algorithms

SMC algorithms are attractive because they produce an arbitrarily accurate approximation to the full
posterior. However in many applications a single good tree is often times sufﬁcient. We describe a
few greedy algorithms to construct a good tree.
Greedy-MaxProb: the obvious greedy algorithm is to pick δi, ρli and ρri maximizing the ith term
in (7). We do so by computing the optimal δi for each pair of ρli, ρri, and then picking the pair
maximizing the ith term at its optimal δi. Greedy-MinDuration: simply pick the pair to coalesce
whose optimal duration is minimum. Both algorithms require recomputing the optimal duration for

each pair at each iteration, since the exponential rate(cid:0)n−i+1
each pair ρli and ρri we determine the optimal δi, but replacing the(cid:0)n−i+1

(cid:1) on the duration varies with the iteration
(cid:1) prior rate with 1. We

i. The total computational cost is thus O(n3). We can avoid this by using the alternative view of the
n-coalesent as a Markov process where each pair of lineages coalesces at rate 1. Greedy-Rate1: for

coalesce the pair with most recent time (as in Greedy-MinDuration). This reduces the complexity to
O(n2). We found that all three perform about equally well.

1If the Markov process is stationary with equilibrium q(y), Zρi (x, θi) is a likelihood ratio between two
models with observations xρi: (1) a single tree with leaves ρi; (2) two independent trees with leaves ρli and ρri
respectively. This is similar to [6, 7] and is used later in our NIPS experiment to determine coherent clusters.

4.3 Examples

Brownian diffusion. Consider the case of continuous data evolving via Brownian diffusion. The
transition kernel kst(y,·) is a Gaussian centred at y with variance (t − s)Λ, where Λ is a symmetric
p.d. covariance matrix. Because the joint distribution (3) over x, y and z is Gaussian, we can express

4.4 Hyperparameter estimation and predictive density

We perform hyperparameter estimation by iterating between estimating a geneology, then re-
estimating the hyperparamters conditioned on this tree. Space precludes a detailed discussion of
the algorithms we use; they can be found in the supplemental material. In the Brownian case, we
place an inverse Wishart prior on Λ and the MAP posterior ˆΛ is available in a standard closed form.
In the multinomial case, the updates are not available analytically and must be solved iteratively.
Given a tree and a new individual y(cid:48) we wish to know: (a) where y(cid:48) might coalescent and (b) what
the density is at y(cid:48). In the supplemental material, we show that the probability that y(cid:48) merges at
time t with a given sibling is available in closed form for the Brownian motion case. To obtain the
density, we sum over all possible siblings and integrate out t by drawing equally spaced samples.

5 Experiments

Synthetic Data Sets
In Figure 2 we compare the various SMC algorithms and Greedy-Rate12 on
a range of synthetic data sets drawn from the Brownian diffusion coalescent process itself (Λ = ID)
to investigate the effects of various parameters on the efﬁcacy of the algorithms. Generally SMC-
PostPost performed best, followed by SMC-PriorPost, SMC-PriorPrior and Greedy-Rate1. With
increasing D the amount of data given to the algorithms increases and all algorithms do better,
especially Greedy-Rate1. This is because the posterior becomes concentrated and the Greedy-Rate1
approximation corresponds well with the posterior. As n increases, the amount of data increases
as well and all algorithms perform better3. However, the posterior space also increases and SMC-
PriorPrior which simply samples from the prior over genealogies does not improve as much. We
see this effect as well when S is small. As S increases all SMC algorithms improve. Finally, the
algorithms were surprisingly robust when there is mismatch between the generated data sets’ λ and
the λ used by the model. We expected all models to perform worse with SMC-PostPost best able to
maintain its performance (though this is possibly due to our experimental setup).

2We found in unreported experiments that the greedy algorithms worked about equally well.
3Each panel was generated from independent runs. Data set variance affected all algorithms, varying overall

performance across panels. However, trends in each panel are still valid, as they are based on the same data.

MNIST and SPAMBASE We compare the performance of our approach (Greedy-Rate1 with
10 iterations of hyperparameter update) to two other hierarchical clustering algorithms: average-
link agglomerative clustering and Bayesian hierarchical clustering [6].
In MNIST, We use 10
digits from the MNIST data set, 20 examplars for each digit and 20 dimensions (reduced via
PCA), repeating the experiment 50 times.
In SPAMBASE, we use 100 examples of 57 at-
tributes each from 2 classes, repeating 20 times. We present purity scores [6], subtree scores
(#{interior nodes with all leaves of same class}/(n − #classes)) and leave-one-out accuracies (all
scores between 0 and 1, higher better). The results are in Table 1; as we can see, except for purity on
SPAMBASE, ours gives the best performance. Experiments not presented here show that all greedy
algorithms perform about the same and that performance improves with hyperparameter updates.

Phylolinguistics We apply our approach (Greedy-Rate1) to a phylolinguistic problem: language
Unlike previous research [13] which studies only phonological data, we use a full
evolution.
the World Atlas of Language
typological database of 139 binary features over 2150 languages:
Structures (henceforth, “WALS”) [14]. The data is sparse: about 84% of the entries are unknown.
We use the same version of the database as extracted by [15]. Based on the Indo-European subset of
this data for which at most 30 features are unknown (48 language total), we recover the coalescent
tree shown in Figure 3(a). Each language is shown with its genus, allowing us to observe that it
teases apart Germanic and Romance languages, but makes a few errors with respect to Iranian and
Greek. (In the supplemental material, we report results applied to a wider range of languages.)
Next, we compare predictive abilities to other algorithms. We take a subset of WALS and tested on
5% of withheld entries, restoring these with various techniques: Greedy-Rate1; nearest neighbors
(use value from nearest observed neighbor); average-linkage (nearest neighbor in the tree); and
probabilistic PCA (latent dimensions in 5, 10, 20, 40, chosen optimistically). We use ﬁve subsets
of the WALS database of varying size, obtained by sorting both the languages and features of the
database according to how many cells are observed. We then use a varying percentage (10%−50%)
of the densest portion. The results are in Figure 3(b). The performance of PPCA is steady around
76%. The performance of the other algorithms degrades as the sparsity incrases. Our approach
performs at least as well as all the other techniques, except at the two extremes.

NIPS We applied Greedy-Rate1 to all NIPS abstracts through NIPS12 (1740, total). The data was
preprocessed so that only words occuring in at least 100 abstracts were retained. The word counts
were then converted to binary. We performed one iteration of hyperparameter re-estimation. In the

generate a ﬂat clustering. To do so, we use the log likelihood ratio at each branch in the coalescent
to determine if a split should occur. If the log likelihood ratio is greater than zero, we break the
branch; otherwise, we recurse down. On the NIPS abstracts, this leads to nine clusters, depicted
in Table 2. Note that clusters two and three are quite similar—had we used a slighly higher log
likelihood ratio, they would have been merged (the LLR for cluster 2 was only 0.105). Note that
the clustering is able to tease apart Bayesian learning (cluster 5) and non-bayesian learning (cluster
7)—both of which have Mike Jordan as their top author!

6 Discussion

We described a new model for Bayesian agglomerative clustering. We used Kingman’s coalescent
as our prior over trees, and derived efﬁcient and easily implementable greedy and SMC inference
algorithms for the model. We showed empirically that our model gives better performance than other
agglomerative clustering algorithms, and gives good results on applications to document modeling
and phylolinguistics.
Our model is most similar in spirit to the Dirichlet diffusion tree of [2]. Both use inﬁnitely exchange-
able priors over trees. While [2] uses a fragmentation process for trees, our prior uses the reverse—a

This allows us to develop simpler inference algorithms than those in
[2], though it will be interesting to consider the possibility of developing analogous algorithms for
[2]. [3] also describes a hierarchical clustering model involving a prior over trees, but his prior is
not inﬁnitely exchangeable. [5] uses tree-consistent partitions to model relational data; it would be
interesting to apply our approach to their setting. Another related work is the Bayesian hierarchical
clustering of [6], which uses an agglomerative procedure returning a tree structured approximate
posterior for a Dirichlet process mixture model. As opposed to our work [6] uses a ﬂat mixture
model and does not have a notion of distributions over trees.
There are a number of unresolved issues with our work. Firstly, our algorithms take O(n3) compu-
tation time, except for Greedy-Rate1 which takes O(n2) time. Among the greedy algorithms we see
that there are no discernible differences in quality of approximation thus we recommend Greedy-
Rate1. It would be interesting to develop SMC algorithms with O(n2) runtime. Secondly, there
are unanswered statistical questions. For example, since our prior is inﬁnitely exchangeable, by de
Finetti’s theorem there is an underlying random distribution for which our observations are i.i.d.
draws. What is this underlying random distribution, and how do samples from this distribution look
like? We know the answer for at least a simple case: if the Markov process is a mutation process
with mutation rate α/2 and new states are drawn i.i.d. from a base distribution H, then the induced
distribution is a Dirichlet process DP(α, H) [8]. Another issue is that of consistency—does the
posterior over random distributions converge to the true distribution as the number of observations
grows? Finally, it would be interesting to generalize our approach to varying mutation rates, and to
non-binary trees by using generalizations to Kingman’s coalescent called Λ-coalescents [16].
