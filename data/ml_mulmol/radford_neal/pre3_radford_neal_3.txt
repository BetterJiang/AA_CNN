sim ann mov fro a tra dis to a dis - tio of int via a seq of int dis has tra bee use as an ine met of han iso mod in mar cha sam .
her , it is sho how one can use the mar cha tra for suc an ann seq to den an imp sam .
the mar cha asp all thi met to per - for acc eve for hig - dim pro , whe ndi goo imp sam dis wou oth be ver dic , whi the use of imp wei ens tha the est fou con to the cor val as the num of ann run inc .
thi ann imp sam pro res the sec hal of the pre - stu tem tra , and can be see as a gen of a rec - pro var of seq imp sam .
it is als rel to the int met for est rat of nor con .
ann imp sam is mos att whe iso mod are pre , or whe est of nor con are req , but it may als be mor gen use , sin its ind sam all one to byp som of the pro of ass con and aut in mar cha sam .
in bay sta and sta phy , exp of var qua wit res to com dis mus oft be com .
for sim dis , we can est exp by sam ave bas on poi dra ind fro the dis of int .
thi sim mon car app can be use whe the dis is too com to all eas gen of ind poi .
we mig ins gen ind poi fro som sim app dis , and the use an imp sam est , in whi the poi are wei to com - sat for use of the wro dis .

i sho in thi pap how the two app can be com , by usi an imp sam dis den by a ser of mar cha .
thi met is ins by the ide of ann as a way of cop wit iso mod , whi lea me to cal it ann imp sam .
the met is esp sui whe mul may be a pro , but may be att eve whe it is not , sin it all one to byp som of the pro of con ass .
ann imp sam als sup an est for the nor con of the dis sam fro .
