we mig the use bot of the ste in tur .
for ins , we mig alt bet per 123 upd wit w = 123 and per 123 upd wit w = 123
alt thi pro may avo dis by ens tha we use a goo ste at lea som of the tim , it wil be rea eci onl whe w = 123 is the bes ste , in whi cas we wil be usi the rig ste for 123 / ( 123 + 123 ) = 123 / 123 of the tim .
whe w = 123 is the bes ste siz , but w = 123 is too lar , alm all the 123 upd don wit w = 123 wil be rej , so onl 123 / ( 123 + 123 ) = 123 / 123 of the upd wil be use , whi see les tha sat .
sup , how , tha we cou som arr tha sim a seq of met upd don usi a ste tha is too lar , and whi the are alm alw rej , tak lit com tim .
in par , sup tha sim a seq of k met upd wit a ste tha alm alw lea to rej can be don in the sam tim as 123 ord met upd , reg of how lar k is .
wit thi sho - cut met , the str des abo is att eve whe w = 123 is the bes ste the 123 upd wit w = 123 are don in the sam tim as 123 ord upd , so 123 / ( 123 + 123 ) = 123 / 123 of the tim is dev to upd wit the bes ste .
a var on thi app is pos if a we can als tak a sho - cut whe sim a seq of met upd in whi the rej rat is muc sma tha des .
sup tha a seq of k upd can be eec red to onl 123 upd whe alm no upd are rej , or whe alm all upd are rej , reg of how lar k is .
we cou the alt per a seq of 123 upd wit w = 123 and a seq of 123 upd wit w = 123
if onl one of the val for w pro a rea rej rat ( not nea 123 or 123 ) , the 123 / ( 123 ) =12 / 123 of our tim wil be spe sim the use upd , wit onl 123 / 123 of our tim was on upd for whi the ste is too lar or too sma .

to vie a met upd as a det tra , we nee to tem int aux var , a tec tha is fam fro oth mcm met as wel , suc as sli sam ( nea 123 ) .

we can int the aux var y tem by sam a val for it fro ( y|x ) , per an upd of ( x , y ) , and the dis y .
it is eas to see tha thi pro lea ( x ) inv if the upd for ( x , y ) lea ( x , y ) inv .

sup the des dis for the sta , z , has den ( z ) .
let t ( z ) be a 123 - to - 123 map fro the sta spa ont its .
if z has den ( z ) , and z = t ( z ) , the acc to the sta for for tra of pro den , the den of z is ( t 123 ( z ) ) / | det t ( t 123 ( z ) ) | , whe t ( z ) is the jac mat for the tra .

we wil try to est the mea of thi dis fro poi gen usi met upd .
the tru val of the mea is ( 123 / 123 ) 123 + ( 123 / 123 ) 123 = 123
i use a gau pro dis cen on the cur sta , wit sta dev w ( in oth wor , was gau wit mea zer and sta dev 123 , so tha w had sta dev w ) .

sin the act dis is a mix of the two , we mig be unc whe the bes ste is w = 123 or w = 123 , or we mig thi tha we nee to use bot ste at die tim .
