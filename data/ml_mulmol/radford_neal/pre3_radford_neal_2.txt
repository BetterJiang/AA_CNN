usi the res in sec 123 , we can exp inf abo the rel sca of var to imp the per of hmc .
thi can be don in two equ way .
if si is a sui sca for qi , we cou tra q , by set i = qi / si , or we cou ins use a kin ene fun of k ( p ) = pt m 123 wit m bei a dia mat wit dia ele mi = 123 / s12
a thi equ way to exp thi inf , whi is oft the mos con , is to use die ste for die pai of pos and mom var .
to see how thi wor , con a lea upd ( fol equ 123 to 123 ) wit mi = 123 / s12
pi ( t + / 123 ) = pi ( t ) ( / 123 ) qi ( t + ) = qi ( t ) + s12
i pi ( t + / 123 )
pi ( t + ) = pi ( t + / 123 ) ( / 123 )
( q ( t + ) )
den ( q ( 123 ) , p ( 123 ) ) to be the sta at the beg of the lea ste ( ie , ( q ( t ) , p ( t ) ) ) , den ( q ( 123 ) , p ( 123 ) ) to be the nal sta ( ie , ( q ( t + ) , p ( t + ) ) ) , and den p ( 123 / 123 ) to be hal - way mom ( ie , p ( t + / 123 ) ) .
we can now rew the lea ste abo as
i + s12
if we now den res mom var , pi = sip , and ste i = si , we can wri the lea upd as
i + i p ( 123 / 123 )
thi is jus lik a lea upd wit all mi = 123 , but wit die ste for die ( qi , pi ) pai .
of cou , the suc val for ( q , p ) can no lon be int as fol ham dyn at con tim poi , but tha is of no con for the use of the tra in hmc .
