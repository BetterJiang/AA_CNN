with the advent of the web and specialized digital text collections , automated extraction of useful information from text has become an increasingly important research area in information retrieval , statistical natural language processing , and machine learning .
applications include document annotation , database organiza - tion , query answering , and automated summarization of text collections .
statistical approaches based upon generative models have proven e ( cid : 123 ) ective in addressing these problems , providing e ( cid : 123 ) cient methods for extracting structured representations from large document collections .
in this paper we describe a generative model for document collections , the author - topic ( at ) model , that simultaneously models the content of documents and the interests of authors .
this generative model represents each document as a mixture of probabilistic topics , in a manner similar to latent dirichlet allocation ( blei et al .
it extends previous work using probabilistic topics to author modeling by allowing the mixture weights for di ( cid : 123 ) erent topics to be determined by the authors of the document .
by learning the parameters of the model , we obtain the set of topics that appear in a corpus and their relevance to di ( cid : 123 ) erent documents , and identify which topics are used by which authors .
figure 123 shows an example of several such topics ( with associated authors and words ) as obtained from a single sample of the gibbs sampler trained on a collection of papers from the annual neural information processing systems ( nips ) conferences ( these will be discussed in more detail later in the paper ) .
both the words and the authors associated with each topic are quite focused and re ( cid : 123 ) ect a variety of di ( cid : 123 ) erent and quite speci ( cid : 123 ) c research areas associated with the nips conference .
the model used in figure 123 also produces a topic distribution for each author|figure 123 shows the likely topics for a set of well - known nips authors from this model .
by modeling the interests of authors , we can answer a range of queries about the content of document collections , including ( for example ) which subjects an author writes about , which authors are likely to have written documents similar to an observed document , and which authors produce
the generative model at the heart of our approach is based upon the idea that a document can be represented as a mixture of topics .
this idea has motivated several di ( cid : 123 ) erent approaches in machine learning and statistical natural language processing ( hofmann 123; blei et al .
123; minka and la ( cid : 123 ) erty 123; gri ( cid : 123 ) ths and steyvers 123; buntine and jakulin 123 ) .
topic models have three major advantages over other approaches to document modeling : the topics are extracted in a completely unsupervised fashion , requiring no document labels and no special initialization; each topic is individually interpretable , providing a representation that can be understood by the user; and each document can express multiple topics , capturing the topic combinations that arise in text documents .
supervised learning techniques for automated categorization of documents into known classes or topics have received considerable attention in recent years ( e . g . , yang ( 123 ) ) .
however , unsupervised methods are often necessary for address -

selected authors from the nips corpus , and four high - probability topics for each author from the author - topic model .
topics unrelated to technical content ( such as topics containing words such as results , methods , experiments , etc . ) were excluded .
ing the challenges of modeling large document collections .
for many document collections , neither prede ( cid : 123 ) ned topics nor labeled documents may be available .
fur - thermore , there is considerable motivation to uncover hidden topic structure in large corpora , particularly in rapidly changing ( cid : 123 ) elds such as computer science and biology , where prede ( cid : 123 ) ned topic categories may not re ( cid : 123 ) ect dynamically evolving
topic models provide an unsupervised method for extracting an interpretable representation from a collection of documents .
prior work on automatic extraction of representations from text has used a number of di ( cid : 123 ) erent approaches .
one general approach , in the context of the general \bag of words " framework , is to represent high - dimensional term vectors in a lower - dimensional space .
local regions in the lower - dimensional space can then be associated with speci ( cid : 123 ) c topics .
for example , the websom system ( lagus et al .
123 ) uses non - linear dimensionality reduction via self - organizing maps to represent term vectors in a two - dimensional layout .
linear projection techniques , such as latent semantic indexing ( lsi ) , are also widely used ( e . g . , berry et al .
( 123 ) ) .
deerwester et al .
( 123 ) , while not using the term \topics " per se , state :
acm transactions on information systems , vol .
n , march 123
learning author - topic models from text corpora
in various problems , we have approximated the original term - document matrix using 123 - 123 orthogonal factors or derived dimensions .
roughly speaking , these factors may be thought of as arti ( cid : 123 ) cial concepts; they rep - resent extracted common meaning components of many di ( cid : 123 ) erent words
a well - known drawback of the lsi approach is that the resulting representation is often hard to interpret .
the derived dimensions indicate axes of a space , but there is no guarantee that such dimensions will make sense to the user of the method .
another limitation of lsi is that it implicitly assumes a gaussian ( squared - error ) noise model for the word - count data , which can lead to implausible results such as predictions of negative counts .
a di ( cid : 123 ) erent approach to unsupervised topic extraction relies on clustering docu - ments into groups containing ( presumably ) similar semantic content .
a variety of well - known document clustering techniques have been used for this purpose ( e . g . , cutting et al .
( 123 ) ; mccallum et al .
( 123 ) ; popescul et al .
( 123 ) ; dhillon and modha ( 123 ) ) .
each cluster of documents can then be associated with a la - tent topic as represented ( for example ) by the mean term vector for documents in the cluster .
while clustering can provide useful broad information about topics , clusters are inherently limited by the fact that each document is ( typically ) only associated with one cluster .
this is often at odds with the multi - topic nature of text documents in many contexts|combinations of diverse topics within a single document are di ( cid : 123 ) cult to represent .
for example , the present paper contains at least two signi ( cid : 123 ) cantly di ( cid : 123 ) erent topics : document modeling and bayesian estima - tion .
for this reason , other representations that allow documents to be composed of multiple topics generally provide better models for sets of documents ( e . g . , better out of sample predictions , blei et al .
( 123 ) ) .
there are several generative models for document collections that model indi - vidual documents as mixtures of topics .
hofmann ( 123 ) introduced the aspect model ( also referred to as probabilistic lsi , or plsi ) as a probabilistic alternative to projection and clustering methods .
in plsi , topics are modeled as multinomial probability distributions over words , and documents are assumed to be generated by the activation of multiple topics .
while the plsi model produced impressive results on a number of text document problems such as information retrieval , the parameterization of the model was susceptible to over ( cid : 123 ) tting and did not provide a straightforward way to make inferences about documents not seen in the training data .
blei et al .
( 123 ) addressed these limitations by proposing a more general bayesian probabilistic topic model called latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) .
the parameters of the lda model ( the topic - word and document - topic distributions ) are estimated using an approximate inference technique known as variational em , since standard estimation methods are intractable .
gri ( cid : 123 ) ths and steyvers ( 123 ) further showed how gibbs sampling , a markov chain monte carlo technique , could be applied to the problem of parameter estimation for this model with relatively large data sets .
more recent research on topic models in information retrieval has focused on including additional sources of information to constrain the learned topics .
for ex - ample , cohn and hofmann ( 123 ) proposed an extension of plsi to model both the
acm transactions on information systems , vol .
n , march 123
michal rosen - zvi et al .
document content as well as citations or hyperlinks between documents .
similarly , erosheva et al .
( 123 ) extended the lda model to model both text and citations and applied their model to scienti ( cid : 123 ) c papers from the proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
other recent work on topic models focused on incorporat - ing correlations among topics ( blei and la ( cid : 123 ) erty 123a; li and mccallum 123 ) , incorporating time dependent topics ( blei and la ( cid : 123 ) erty 123b ) , and incorporating context ( mei and zhai 123 ) .
our aim in this paper is to extend probabilistic topic models to include authorship information .
joint author - topic modeling has received little or no attention as far as we are aware .
the areas of stylometry , authorship attribution , and forensic linguistics focus on the related but di ( cid : 123 ) erent problem of identifying which author ( among a set of possible authors ) wrote a particular piece of text ( holmes 123 ) .
for example , mosteller and wallace ( 123 ) used bayesian techniques to infer whether hamilton or madison was the more likely author of disputed federalist papers .
more recent work of a similar nature includes authorship analysis of a purported poem by shakespeare ( thisted and efron 123 ) , identifying authors of software programs ( gray et al .
123 ) , and the use of techniques such as neural networks ( kjell 123 ) and support vector machines ( diederich et al .
123 ) for author identi ( cid : 123 ) cation .
these author identi ( cid : 123 ) cation methods emphasize the use of distinctive stylistic features ( such as sentence length ) that characterize a speci ( cid : 123 ) c author .
in contrast , the models we present here focus on extracting the general semantic content of a document , rather than the stylistic details of how it was written .
for example , in our model we omit common \stop " words since they are generally irrelevant to the topic of the document|however , the distributions of stop words can be quite useful in stylometry .
while topic information could be usefully combined with stylistic features for author classi ( cid : 123 ) cation we do not pursue this idea in this particular paper .
graph - based and network - based models are also frequently used as a basis for representation and analysis of relations among scienti ( cid : 123 ) c authors .
for example , mccain ( 123 ) , newman ( 123 ) , mutschke ( 123 ) and erten et al .
( 123 ) use a variety of methods from bibliometrics , social networks , and graph theory to analyze and visualize co - author and citation relations in the scienti ( cid : 123 ) c literature .
kautz et al .
( 123 ) developed the interactive referralweb system for exploring networks of computer scientists working in arti ( cid : 123 ) cial intelligence and information retrieval , and white and smyth ( 123 ) used pagerank - style ranking algorithms to analyze co - author graphs .
in all of this work only the network connectivity information is used|the text information from the underlying documents is not used in modeling .
thus , while the grouping of authors via these network models can implicitly provide indications of latent topics , there is no explicit representation of the topics in terms of the content ( the words ) of the documents .
this paper is about a novel probabilistic model that represents both authors and topics .
it extends the previous work introduced by the authors in steyvers et al .
( 123 ) ; rosen - zvi et al .
( 123 ) by providing a systematic comparison of the author - topic model to other existing models , showing how the author - topic model can be applied as an extension of the lda model with the use of ( cid : 123 ) ctitious authors and illustrating a number of applications of the model .
the outline of the paper is as follows : section 123 describes the author - topic model
acm transactions on information systems , vol .

learning author - topic models from text corpora
and section 123 outlines how the parameters of the model ( the topic - word distribu - tions and author - topic distributions ) can be learned from training data consisting of documents with known authors .
section 123 discusses the application of the model to three di ( cid : 123 ) erent document collections : papers from the nips conferences , abstracts from the citeseer collection , and emails from enron .
the section includes a general discussion of convergence and stability in learning , and examples of speci ( cid : 123 ) c topics and speci ( cid : 123 ) c author models that are learned by the algorithm .
in section 123 we describe illustrative applications of the model , including detecting unusual papers for selected authors and detecting which parts of a text were written by di ( cid : 123 ) erent authors .
section 123 compares and contrasts the proposed author - topic model with a number of related models , including the lda model , a simple author model ( with no topics ) , and a model allowing \ ( cid : 123 ) ctitious authors " , and includes experiments quantifying test set perplexity and precision - recall , for di ( cid : 123 ) erent models .
section 123 contains a brief discussion and concluding comments .
the author - topic ( at ) model
in this section we introduce the author - topic model .
the author topic model be - longs to a family of generative models for text where words are viewed as discrete random variables , a document contains a ( cid : 123 ) xed number of words , and each word takes one value from a prede ( cid : 123 ) ned vocabulary .
we will use integers to denote the entries in the vocabulary , with each word w taking a value from 123; : : : ; w where w is the number of unique words in the vocabulary .
a document d is represented as a vector of words , wd , with nd entries .
a corpus with d documents is repre - sented as a concatenation of the document vectors , which we will denote w , having d=123 nd entries .
in addition to these words , we have information about the authors of each document .
we de ( cid : 123 ) ne ad to be the set of authors of document d .
ad consists of elements that are integers from 123; : : : ; a , where a is the number of authors who generated the documents in the corpus .
ad will be used to denote the number of authors of document d .
n = pd
to illustrate this notation , consider a simple example .
say we have d = 123 documents in the corpus , written by a = 123 authors that use a vocabulary with w = 123 unique words .
the ( cid : 123 ) rst author ( author 123 ) wrote paper 123 , author 123 wrote paper 123 , and they co - authored paper 123
according to our notation , a123 = ( 123 ) , a123 = ( 123 ) and a123 = ( 123; 123 ) , and a123 = 123 , a123 = 123 , and a123 = 123
say the ( cid : 123 ) rst document contains a single line , \language modeling " has an abundance of interesting research problems .
we can remove stop words such as has , an , and of , to leave a document with 123 words .
if language is the 123th entry in the vocabulary , modeling is the 123th , and abundance is the 123th , then w123 = 123 , w123 = 123 , w123 = 123 , and so on .
the author - topic model is a hierarchical generative model in which each word w in a document is associated with two latent variables : an author , x and a topic , z .
these latent variables augment the n - dimensional vector w ( indicating the values of all words in the corpus ) with two additional n - dimensional vectors z and x , indicating topic and author assignments for the n words .
for the purposes of estimation , we assume that the set of authors of each docu - ment is observed .
this leaves unresolved the issue of having unobserved authors , and avoids the need to de ( cid : 123 ) ne a prior on authors , which is outside of the scope of

each author is associated with a multinomial distribution over topics .
conditioned on the set of authors and their distributions over topics , the process by which a document is generated can be summarized as follows : ( cid : 123 ) rst , an author is chosen uniformly at random for each word that will appear in the document; next , a topic is sampled for each word from the distribution over topics associated with the author of that word; ( cid : 123 ) nally , the words themselves are sampled from the distribution over words associated with each topic .
this generative process can be expressed more formally by de ( cid : 123 ) ning some of the other variables in the model .
assume we have t topics .
we can parameterize the multinomial distribution over topics for each author using a matrix ( cid : 123 ) of size t ( cid : 123 ) a , with elements ( cid : 123 ) ta that stand for the probability of assigning topic t to a t=123 ( cid : 123 ) ta = 123 , and for simplicity of notation we will drop the index t when convenient and use ( cid : 123 ) a to stand for the ath column of the matrix .
the multinomial distributions over words associated with each topic are parameterized by a matrix ( cid : 123 ) of size w ( cid : 123 ) t , with elements ( cid : 123 ) wt that stand for the w=123 ( cid : 123 ) wt = 123 , and ( cid : 123 ) t stands for the tth column of the matrix .
these multinomial distributions are assumed to be generated from symmetric dirichlet priors with hyperparameters ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) respectively .
in the results in this paper we assume that these hyperparameters are ( cid : 123 ) xed .

graphical model for the author - topic model .
the following generative process :
123 : for each author a = 123; : : : ; a choose ( cid : 123 ) a ( cid : 123 ) dirichlet ( ( cid : 123 ) )
for each topic t = 123; : : : ; t choose ( cid : 123 ) t ( cid : 123 ) dirichlet ( ( cid : 123 ) )
123 : for each document d = 123; : : : ; d given the vector of authors ad for each word i = 123; : : : ; nd
conditioned on ad choose an author xdi ( cid : 123 ) uniform ( ad ) conditioned on xdi choose a topic zdi ( cid : 123 ) discrete ( ( cid : 123 ) xdi ) conditioned on zdi choose a word wdi ( cid : 123 ) discrete ( ( cid : 123 ) zdi )
the graphical model corresponding to this process is shown in figure 123
note that by de ( cid : 123 ) ning the model we ( cid : 123 ) x the number of possible topics to t .
in circumstances where the number of topics is not determined by the application , methods such as comparison of bayes factors ( e . g . , gri ( cid : 123 ) ths and steyvers ( 123 ) ) or non - parametric bayesian statistics ( e . g . , teh et al .
( 123 ) ) can be used to infer t from a data set .
in this paper , we will deal with the case where t is ( cid : 123 ) xed .
under this generative process , each topic is drawn independently when condi - tioned on ( cid : 123 ) , and each word is drawn independently when conditioned on ( cid : 123 ) and z .
the probability of the corpus w , conditioned on ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) ( and implicitly on a ( cid : 123 ) xed number of topics t ) , is
p ( wj ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ; a ) =
p ( wdj ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ; ad ) :

p ( wdi; zdi = t; xdi = aj ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ; ad ) )
p ( wdijzdi = t; ( cid : 123 ) ) p ( zdi = tjxdi = a; ( cid : 123 ) ) p ( xdi = ajad )
where the factorization in the third line makes use of the conditional independence assumptions of the model .
the last line in the equations above expresses the prob - ability of the words w in terms the entries of the parameter matrices ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) intro - duced earlier .
the probability distribution over author assignments , p ( xdi = ajad ) , is assumed to be uniform over the elements of ad , and deterministic if ad = 123
the probability distribution over topic assignments , p ( zdi = tjxdi = a; ( cid : 123 ) ) is the multi - nomial distribution ( cid : 123 ) a in ( cid : 123 ) that corresponds to author a , and the probability of a word given a topic assignment , p ( wdijzdi = t; ( cid : 123 ) ) is the multinomial distribution ( cid : 123 ) t in ( cid : 123 ) that corresponds to topic t .
equations 123 and 123 can be used to compute the probability of a corpus w con - ditioned on ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) , i . e . , the likelihood of a corpus .
if ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) are treated as parameters of the model , this likelihood can be used in maximum - likelihood or maximum - a - posteriori estimation .
another strategy is to treat ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) as random variables , and compute the marginal probability of a corpus by integrating them out .
under this strategy , the probability of w becomes
p ( wja; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) = z ( cid : 123 ) z ( cid : 123 )
p ( wja; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) p ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) j ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) d ( cid : 123 ) d ( cid : 123 )

learning the author - topic model from data
the author - topic model contains two continuous random variables , ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) .
var - ious approximate inference methods have recently been employed for estimating the posterior distribution for continuous random variables in hierarchical bayesian models .
these approximate inference algorithms range from variational inference ( blei et al .
123 ) and expectation propagation ( minka and la ( cid : 123 ) erty 123 ) to mcmc schemes ( pritchard et al .
123; gri ( cid : 123 ) ths and steyvers 123; buntine and jakulin 123 ) .
the inference scheme used in this paper is based upon a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm or more speci ( cid : 123 ) cally , gibbs sampling .
while mcmc is

not necessarily as computationally e ( cid : 123 ) cient as approximation schemes such as vari - ational inference and expectation propagation , it is unbiased and has been success - fully used in several recent large scale applications of topic models ( buntine and jakulin 123; gri ( cid : 123 ) ths and steyvers 123 ) .
our aim is to estimate the posterior distribution , p ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) jdtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) .
samples from this distribution can be useful in many applications , as illustrated in section 123 .
this is also the distribution used for evaluating the predictive power of the model ( e . g . , see section 123 ) and for deriving other quantities , such as the most surprising paper for an author ( section 123 ) .
our inference scheme is based upon the observation that
p ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) jdtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) =xz;x
p ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) jz; x; dtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) p ( z; xjdtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) :
we obtain an approximate posterior on ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) by using a gibbs sampler to compute the sum over z and x .
this process involves two steps .
first , we ob - tain an empirical sample - based estimate of p ( z; xjdtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) using gibbs sam - pling .
second , for any speci ( cid : 123 ) c sample corresponding to a particular x and z , p ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) jz; x; dtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) can be computed directly by exploiting the fact that the dirichlet distribution is conjugate to the multinomial .
in the next two sections we will explain each of these two steps in turn .
123 gibbs sampling
gibbs sampling is a form of markov chain monte carlo , in which a markov chain is constructed to have a particular stationary distribution ( e . g . , gilks et al .
( 123 ) ) .
in our case , we wish to construct a markov chain which converges to the posterior distribution over x and z conditioned on dtrain , ( cid : 123 ) , and ( cid : 123 ) .
using gibbs sampling we can generate a sample from the joint distribution p ( z; xjdtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) by ( a ) sampling an author assignment xdi and a topic assignment zdi for an individual word wdi , conditioned on ( cid : 123 ) xed assignments of authors and topics for all other words in the corpus , and ( b ) repeating this process for each word .
a single gibbs sampling iteration consists of sequentially performing this sampling of author and topic assignments for each individual word in the corpus .
in appendix a we show how to derive the following basic equation needed for
the gibbs sampler :
p ( xdi = a; zdi = tjwdi = w; z ( cid : 123 ) di; x ( cid : 123 ) di; w ( cid : 123 ) di; a; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) /
wt; ( cid : 123 ) di + ( cid : 123 ) w123t; ( cid : 123 ) di + w ( cid : 123 )
pw123 cw t
ta; ( cid : 123 ) di + ( cid : 123 ) t123a; ( cid : 123 ) di + t ( cid : 123 )
pt123 c t a
for a 123 ad .
here c t a represents the topic - author count matrix , where c t a the number of words assigned to topic t for author a excluding the topic assignment to word wdi .
similarly c w t is the word - topic count matrix , where c w t wt; ( cid : 123 ) di is the number of words from the wth entry in the vocabulary assigned to topic t excluding the topic assignment to word wdi .
finally , z ( cid : 123 ) di; x ( cid : 123 ) di; w ( cid : 123 ) di stand for the vector of topic assignments , vector of author assignment and vector of word observations

in all corpus except for the ith word of the dth document , respectively .
the other symbols are summarized in table i .
this equation can be manipulated further to obtain the conditional probability of the topic of the ith word given the rest , p ( zdi = tjz ( cid : 123 ) di; x; dtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) , and for the conditional probability of the author of the ith word given the rest , p ( xdi = ajz; x ( cid : 123 ) di; dtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) .
in the results in this paper we use a blocked sampler where we sample xdi and zdi jointly which improves the mixing time of the sampler ( e . g .
roberts and sahu ( 123 ) ) |empirically we also found an improvement in overall run time compared to sampling xdi and zdi
the algorithm for gibbs sampling works as follows .
we initialize the author and topic assignments , x and z , randomly .
in each gibbs sampling iteration we sequentially draw the topic and author assignment of the dith word from the joint conditional distribution in equation 123 above .
after a prede ( cid : 123 ) ned number of itera - tions ( the so - called burn - in time of the gibbs sampler ) we begin recording samples xs , zs .
the burn - in is intended to allow the sampler to approach its stationary distribution|the posterior distribution p ( z; xjdtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) .
in the results in this paper , for the purpose of displaying particular author - topic and topic - word distri - butions we use the last sample in the chain .
when we make predictions we average over the last sample from each of s = 123 independent chains .
we found that using multiple samples from di ( cid : 123 ) erent chains provided better predictive performance than using multiple samples from the same chain .
in section 123 we discuss these issues in more detail .
the worst case time complexity of each iteration of the gibbs sampler is o ( n amaxt )
where n is the total number of word tokens in the corpus and amax is the max - imum number of authors that can be associated with a single document .
as the complexity is linear in n , gibbs sampling can be e ( cid : 123 ) ciently carried out on large
123 the posterior on ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) given z , x , dtrain , ( cid : 123 ) , and ( cid : 123 ) , computing posterior distributions on ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) is straightforward .
using the fact that the dirichlet is conjugate to the multinomial ,
( cid : 123 ) tjz; dtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ( cid : 123 ) dirichlet ( c w t ( cid : 123 ) ajx; z; dtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ( cid : 123 ) dirichlet ( c t a
( cid : 123 ) t + ( cid : 123 ) )
( cid : 123 ) a + ( cid : 123 ) )
where c w t is the vector of counts of the number of times each word has been assigned to topic t .
evaluating the posterior mean of ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) given x , z , dtrain , ( cid : 123 ) , and ( cid : 123 ) is straightforward .
from equations 123 and 123 , it follows that
e ( ( cid : 123 ) wtjzs; dtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ) =
e ( ( cid : 123 ) tajxs; zs; dtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ) =

pt123 ( c t a
where ( c w t ) s is the matrix of topic - word counts exhibited in zs , and s refers to sample s from the gibbs sampler .
these posterior means also provide point

learning author - topic models from text corpora
estimates for ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) , and correspond to the posterior predictive distribution for the next word from a topic and the next topic in a document respectively .
in many applications , we wish to evaluate the expectation of some function of ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) , such as the likelihood of a document , p ( wdj ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ; ad ) , given dtrain , ( cid : 123 ) , and ( cid : 123 ) .
denoting such a function f ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) , we can use the results above to de ( cid : 123 ) ne a general strategy for evaluating such expectations .
we wish to compute
e ( f ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) jdtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) = ex;zhe ( f ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) jx; z; dtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) i
e ( f ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) jxs; zs; dtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) )
where s is the number of samples obtained from the gibbs sampler .
in practice , computing e ( f ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) jxs; zs; dtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) may be di ( cid : 123 ) cult , as it requires integrating the function over the posterior dirichlet distributions .
when this is the case , we use the approximation e ( f ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) ) ( cid : 123 ) f ( e ( ( cid : 123 ) ) ; e ( ( cid : 123 ) ) ) , where e ( ( cid : 123 ) ) and e ( ( cid : 123 ) ) refer to the posterior means given in equations 123 and 123
this is exact when f is linear , and provides a lower bound when f is convex .
finally , we note that this strategy will only be e ( cid : 123 ) ective if f ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) is invariant under permutations of the columns of ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) .
like any mixture model , the author - topic model su ( cid : 123 ) ers from a lack of identi ( cid : 123 ) ability : the posterior probability of ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) is una ( cid : 123 ) ected by permuting their columns .
consequently , there need be no correspondence between the values in a particular column across multiple samples produced by the gibbs sampler .
experimental results
we trained the author - topic model on three large document data sets .
the ( cid : 123 ) rst is a set of papers from 123 years ( 123 to 123 ) of the neural information process - ing ( nips ) conference123
this data set contains d = 123; 123 papers , a = 123; 123 di ( cid : 123 ) erent authors , a total of n = 123; 123; 123 word tokens , and a vocabulary size of w = 123; 123 unique words .
the second corpus consists of a large collection of extracted abstracts from the citeseer digital library ( lawrence et al .
123 ) , with d = 123; 123 abstracts with a = 123; 123 authors and n = 123; 123; 123 word tokens and a vocabulary of w = 123; 123 unique words .
the third corpus is the enron email data set123 , where we used a set of d = 123; 123 emails , with a = 123; 123 unique authors , and n = 123; 123; 123 word tokens .
we preprocessed each set of documents by removing stop words from a standard list .
for each data set we ran 123 di ( cid : 123 ) erent markov chains , where each was started from a di ( cid : 123 ) erent set of random assignments of authors and topics .
each of the 123 markov chains was run for a ( cid : 123 ) xed number of 123 iterations .
for the nips data set and a 123 - topic solution , 123 iterations of the gibbs sampler took 123 hours of wall - clock time on a standard 123 ghz pc workstation ( 123 seconds per iteration ) .
for a 123 - topic solution , citeseer took on the order of 123 hours for 123 iterations ( 123 minutes per iteration ) , and for a 123 - topic solution enron took 123 hours for 123

iterations ( 123 seconds per iteration ) .
as mentioned earlier , in the experiments described in this paper we do not es - timate the hyperparameters ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) |instead they are ( cid : 123 ) xed at 123=t and 123 : 123 respectively in each of the experiments described below .
123 analyzing the gibbs sampler using perplexity
assessing the convergence of the markov chain used to sample a set of variables is a common issue that arises in applying mcmc techniques .
this issue can be divided into two questions : the practical question of when the performance of a model trained by sampling begins to level out , and the theoretical question of when the markov chain actually reaches the posterior distribution .
in general , for real data sets , there is no foolproof method for answering the latter question .
in this paper we will focus on the former , using the perplexity of the model on test documents to evaluate when the performance of the model begins to stabilize .
the perplexity score of a new unobserved document d that contains words wd ,
and is conditioned on the known authors of the document ad , is de ( cid : 123 ) ned as
perplexity ( wdjad; dtrain ) = exp ( cid : 123 ) ( cid : 123 )
log p ( wdjad; dtrain )
where p ( wdjad; dtrain ) is the probability assigned by the author - topic model ( trained on dtrain ) to the words wd in the test document , conditioned on the known au - thors ad of the test document , and where nd is the number of words in the test document .
to simplify notation here we dropped the explicit dependency on the hyperparameters ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) .
for multiple test documents , we report the average perplex - d=123 perplexity ( wdjad; dtrain ) =dtest .
here dtest stands for the set of documents that were held out for testing and dtest is the number of the documents in this testing set .
the lower the perplexity the better the performance of the model .
ity over documents , i . e . , hperplexityi = pdtest
we can obtain an approximate estimate of perplexity by averaging over multiple
samples , as in equation 123 :
p ( wdjad; dtrain ) ( cid : 123 )
e ( ( cid : 123 ) ta ( cid : 123 ) wditjxs; zs; dtrain; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) # :
in order to ensure that the sampler output covers the entire space we run multiple replications of the mcmc , i . e . , the samples are generated from multiple chains , each starting at a di ( cid : 123 ) erent state ( e . g . , ( brooks 123 ) ) .
empirical results with both the citeseer and nips data sets , using di ( cid : 123 ) erent values for s , indicated that s = 123 samples is a reasonable choice to get a good approximation of the perplexity .
figure 123 shows perplexity as a function of the number of iterations of the gibbs sampler , for a model with 123 topics ( cid : 123 ) t to the citeseer data .
samples xs; zs obtained from the gibbs sampler after s iterations ( where s is the x - axis in the graph ) are used to produce a perplexity score on test documents .
each point represents the averaged perplexity over dtest = 123 citeseer test documents .
the inset in figure 123 shows the perplexity for two di ( cid : 123 ) erent cases .
the upper curves show the perplexity derived from a single sample s = 123 ( upper curves ) , for

the inset shows the perplexity values ( upper curves ) from 123 individual chains during early iterations of the sampler , while the lower curve shows the perplexity obtained by averaging these 123 chains .
the full graph shows the perplexity from averaging again , but now over a larger range of sampling iterations .
123 di ( cid : 123 ) erent such samples ( 123 di ( cid : 123 ) erent gibbs sampler runs ) .
the lower curve in the inset shows the perplexity obtained from averaging over s = 123 samples .
it is clear from the ( cid : 123 ) gure that averaging helps , i . e . , signi ( cid : 123 ) cantly better predictions ( lower perplexity ) are obtained when using multiple samples from the gibbs sampler than just a single sample .
it also appears from figure 123 that performance of models trained using the gibbs sampler appears to stabilize rather quickly ( after about 123 iterations ) , at least in terms of perplexity on test documents .
while this is far from a formal diagnostic test of convergence , it is nonetheless reassuring , and when combined with the results on topic stability and topic interpretation in the next sections , lends some con ( cid : 123 ) dence that the model ( cid : 123 ) nds a relatively stable topic - based representation of the corpus .
qualitatively similar results were obtained for the nips corpus , i . e . , averaging provides a signi ( cid : 123 ) cant reduction in perplexity and the perplexity values \ ( cid : 123 ) atten out " after a 123 or so iterations of the gibbs sampler .
123 topic stability
while perplexity computations can and should be averaged over di ( cid : 123 ) erent gibbs sampler runs , other applications of the model rely on the interpretations of in - dividual topics and are based on the analysis of individual samples .
because of exchangeability of the topics , it is possible that quite di ( cid : 123 ) erent topic solutions are found across samples .
in practice , however , we have found that the topic solutions are relatively stable across samples , with only a small subset of unique topics ap - pearing in any sample .
we assessed topic stability by a greedy alignment algorithm that tries to ( cid : 123 ) nd the best one - to - one topic correspondences across samples .
the algorithm calculates all pairwise symmetrized kl distances between the t topic dis -

darker colors indicate lower kl distances .
the top panel shows the best and worst aligned pair of topics across two samples ( corresponding to the top - left and bottom - right pair of topics on the diagonal of the distance matrix ) .
the best aligned topic pair has an almost identical probability distribution over words whereas the worst aligned topic pair shows no correspondence at all .
roughly 123 of 123 topics have a reasonable degree of correspondence that would be associated with the same subjective interpretation .
we obtained similar results for the citeseer data set .
123 interpreting author - topic model results
we can use point estimates of the author - topic parameters to look at speci ( cid : 123 ) c author - topic and topic - word distributions and related quantities that can be derived from these parameters ( such as the probability of an author given a randomly selected word from a topic ) .
in the results described below we take a speci ( cid : 123 ) c sample xs; zs after 123 iterations from a single ( arbitrarily selected ) gibbs run , and then gen - erate point estimates of ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) using equation 123
equations for computing the conditional probabilities in the di ( cid : 123 ) erent tables are provided in appendix b .

the nips conference is char - acterized by contributions from a number of di ( cid : 123 ) erent research communities within both machine learning and neuroscience .
figure 123 illustrates examples of 123 topics ( out of 123 ) as learned by the model for the nips corpus .
each topic is illustrated with ( a ) the top 123 words most likely to be generated conditioned on the topic , and ( b ) the top 123 most likely authors to have generated a word conditioned on the topic .
the ( cid : 123 ) rst 123 topics we selected for display ( left to right across the top and the ( cid : 123 ) rst two on the left on the bottom ) are quite speci ( cid : 123 ) c representations of di ( cid : 123 ) erent topics that have been popular at the nips conference over the time - period 123 ( 123 : visual modeling , handwritten character recognition , svms and kernel methods , source separation methods , bayesian estimation , and reinforcement learning .
for each topic , the top 123 most likely authors are well - known authors in terms of nips papers written on these topics ( e . g . , singh , barto , and sutton in reinforcement learning ) .
while most ( order of 123 to 123% ) of the 123 topics in the model are similarly speci ( cid : 123 ) c in terms of semantic content , the remaining 123 topics we display illustrate some of the other types of \topics " discovered by the model .
topic 123 is somewhat generic , covering a broad set of terms typical to nips papers , with a somewhat ( cid : 123 ) atter distribution over authors compared to other topics .
these types of topics tend to be broadly spread over many documents in the corpus , and can be viewed as syntactic in the context of nips papers .
in contrast , the \semantic con - tent topics " ( such as the ( cid : 123 ) rst 123 topics in figure 123 ) are more narrowly concentrated within a smaller set of documents .
topic 123 is somewhat oriented towards geo ( cid : 123 ) hintons group at the university of toronto , containing the words that commonly appeared in nips papers authored by members of that research group , with an author list consisting largely of hinton and his students and collaborators .

for example , the most likely authors for the bayesian learning topic are well - known authors who frequently write on this topic at conferences such as uai and nips .
similarly , for the data mining topic , all of the 123 most likely authors are frequent contributors of papers at the annual acm sigkdd conference on data mining .

not all documents in citeseer relate to computer science .
topic 123 , on the right side of figure 123 , is associated with astronomy .
this is due to the fact that citeseer does not crawl the web looking for computer science papers per se , but instead searches for documents that are similar in some sense to a general template format for research papers .

we automatically removed all text from the emails that was not necessarily written by the sender , such as attachments or text that could be clearly identi ( cid : 123 ) ed as being from an earlier email ( e . g . , in reply quotes ) .
the topics learned by the model span both topics that one might expect to see discussed in emails within a company that deals with energy ( topics 123 and 123 ) as well as \topical " topics such as topic 123 that directly relate to the california energy crisis in 123 ( 123
two of the topics are not directly related to o ( cid : 123 ) cial enron business , but instead describe employees personal interests such as texas sports ( 123 ) and
figure 123 shows a table with the most likely topics for 123 of the 123 , 123 possi - ble authors ( email accounts ) .
the ( cid : 123 ) rst three are institutional accounts : enron

michal rosen - zvi et al .
general announcements , outlook migration team ( presumably an internal email account at enron for announcements related to the outlook email program ) , and the motley fool ( a company that provides ( cid : 123 ) nancial education and advice ) .
the topics associated with these authors are quite intuitive .
the most likely topic ( p = 123 : 123 ) for enron general announcements is a topic with words that might typically be associated with general corporate information for enron employees .
the topic distribution for the outlook migration team is skewed towards a single topic ( p = 123 : 123 ) containing words that are quite speci ( cid : 123 ) c to the outlook email pro - gram .
likely topics for the motley fool include both ( cid : 123 ) nance and investing topics , as well as topics with html - related words and a topic for dates .
the other 123 authors shown in figure 123 correspond to email accounts for speci ( cid : 123 ) c individuals in enron| although the original data identi ( cid : 123 ) es individual names for these accounts we do not show them here to respect the privacy of these individuals .
author as topics are typical of what we might expect of a senior employee in enron , with topics related to rates and customers , to the ferc ( federal energy regulatory commission ) , and to the california energy crisis ( including mention of the california governor at the time , gray davis ) .
author bs topics are focused more on day - to - day enron operations ( pipelines , contracts , and facilities ) with an additional topic for more personal matters ( \good , time " , etc ) .
finally , author c appears to be involved in legal aspects of enrons international activities , particularly in central and south america .
the diversity of the topic distributions for di ( cid : 123 ) erent authors in this ex - ample demonstrates clearly how the author - topic model can learn about the roles and interests of di ( cid : 123 ) erent individuals from text that they have written .
illustrative applications of the author - topic model
in this section we provide some illustrative examples of how the author - topic model can be used to answer di ( cid : 123 ) erent types of questions and prediction problems concern - ing authors and documents .
123 automated detection of unusual papers by authors
we illustrate in this section how our model could be useful for detecting papers that were written by di ( cid : 123 ) erent people with the same name .
in digital libraries such as citeseer and google scholar , this type of name disambiguation is an important and di ( cid : 123 ) cult problem .
our goal in this section is not to propose a solution to the author disambiguation problem , but instead to illustrate that author - topic models lead to useful predictions in this context .
perplexity can be used to estimate the likelihood of a particular document con - ditioned on a particular author .
we ( cid : 123 ) rst train a model on dtrain .
for a speci ( cid : 123 ) c author name a ( cid : 123 ) of interest , we then score each document by that author as follows .
we calculate a perplexity score for each document in dtrain as if a ( cid : 123 ) was the only author , i . e . , even for a document with other authors , we condition on only a ( cid : 123 ) .
we use the same equation for perplexity as de ( cid : 123 ) ned in section 123 except that now wd is a document that is in the training data dtrain .
thus , the words in a document are not conditionally independent , given the distribution over the model parameters ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) , as inferred from the training documents .

learning author - topic models from text corpora
for our citeseer corpus , author names are provided with a ( cid : 123 ) rst initial and second name , e . g . , a einstein .
this means of course that for some very common names ( e . g . , j wang or j smith ) there will be multiple actual individuals represented by a single name in the model .
this \noise " in the data provides an opportunity to investigate whether perplexity scores are able to help in separating documents from di ( cid : 123 ) erent authors who have the same ( cid : 123 ) rst initial and last name .
we focused on names of four well - known researchers in the area of arti ( cid : 123 ) cial intelligence , michael jordan ( m jordan ) , daphne koller ( d koller ) , tom mitchell ( t mitchell ) and stuart russell ( s russell ) , and derived perplexity scores in the manner described above using s = 123 samples .
in table ii , for each author , we list the two citeseer abstracts with the highest perplexity scores ( most surprising relative to this authors model ) , the median perplexity , and the two abstracts with the lowest perplexity scores ( least surprising ) .
in these examples , the most perplexing papers ( from the models viewpoint ) for each author are papers that were written by a di ( cid : 123 ) erent person than the person we are primarily interested in .
in each case ( for example for m jordan ) most of the papers in the data set for this author were written by the machine learning researcher of interest ( in this case , michael jordan of uc berkeley ) .
thus , the model is primarily \tuned " to the interests of that author and assigns relatively high perplexity scores to the small number of papers in the set that were written by a di ( cid : 123 ) erent author with the same name .
for m jordan , the most perplexing paper is on programming languages and was in fact written by mick jordan of sun in fact , of the 123 most perplexing papers for m jordan , 123 are on software management and the java programming language , all written by mick jordan .
the other two papers were in fact co - authored by michael jordan of uc berkeley , but in the area of link analysis , which is an unusual topic relative to the many of machine learning - oriented topics that he has typically written about in the
the highest perplexity paper for t mitchell is in fact authored by toby mitchell and is on the topic of estimating radiation doses ( quite di ( cid : 123 ) erent from the machine learning work of tom mitchell ) .
the paper with the second highest perplexity for tom mitchell is about an application of the em algorithm .
this em paper is not nearly so much of an outlier as the compared to the paper on estimating radiation doses since it is relatively close to the median perplexity .
it is reasonable that it has the highest perplexity of any papers that tom mitchell actually authored , given that most of his other work ( prior to 123 in particular , which is the period for which most of our citeseer papers are from ) was focused on knowledge - based learning ( such as the the two papers in the set with the lowest perplexity ) .
the two most perplexing papers for d koller are also not authored by daphne koller of stanford , but by two di ( cid : 123 ) erent researchers , daniel koller and david koller .
moreover , the two most typical ( lowest perplexity ) papers of d koller are prototyp - ical representatives of the research of daphne koller , with words such as learning , bayesian and probabilistic network appearing in the titles of these two papers .
for s russell the two most unlikely papers are about the mungi operating system and have stephen russell as an author .
these papers are relative outliers in terms of their perplexity scores since most of the papers for s russell are about reasoning

automated labeling of a pseudo - abstract from two authors by the model .
in machine learning and darwiche in probabilistic reasoning .
the document is then parsed by the model .
i . e . , words are assigned to these authors .
we would hope that the author - topic model , conditioned now on these two authors , can separate the combined abstract into its component parts .
instead of rerunning the algorithm for every new document added to a text col - lection , our strategy instead is to apply an e ( cid : 123 ) cient monte carlo algorithm that runs only on the word tokens in the new document , leading quickly to likely assign - ments of words to authors and topics .
we start by assigning words randomly to co - authors and topics .
we then sample new assignments of words to topics and au - thors by applying the gibbs sampler only to the word tokens in the new document each time temporarily updating the count matrices c w t and c at .
the resulting assignments of words to authors and topics can be saved after a few iterations ( 123 iterations in our simulations ) .
figure 123 shows the results after the model has classi ( cid : 123 ) ed each word according to the most likely author .
note that the model only sees a bag of words and is not aware of the word order that we see in the ( cid : 123 ) gure .
for readers viewing this in color , the more red a word is then the more likely it is to have been generated ( according to the model ) by scholkopf ( and blue for darwiche ) .
non - colored words are words that are not in the vocabulary of the model .
for readers viewing the ( cid : 123 ) gure in black and white , the superscript 123 indicates words classi ( cid : 123 ) ed by the model for scholkopf , and superscript 123 for darwiche ( a superscript was added whenever the probability of one author or the other was above 123 ) .
the results show that all of the signi ( cid : 123 ) cant content words ( such as kernel , support , vector , diagnoses , directed , graph ) are classi ( cid : 123 ) ed correctly .
as we might expect most of the \errors " are words ( such as \based " or \criterion " ) that are not speci ( cid : 123 ) c to either authors area of research .
were we to use word order in the classi ( cid : 123 ) cation ,
acm transactions on information systems , vol .

michal rosen - zvi et al .
and classify ( for example ) whole sentences , the accuracy would increase further .
as it is , the model correctly classi ( cid : 123 ) es 123% of scholkopfs words and 123% of darwiches .
comparing different generative models
in this section we describe several alternative generative models that model authors and words and discuss similarities and di ( cid : 123 ) erences between these models with our proposed author - topic model .
many of these models are special cases of the author - topic model .
appendix c presents a characterization of several of these models in terms of methods of matrix factorization , which reveals some of these relationships .
in this section , we also compare the predictive power of the author - topic model ( in terms of perplexity on out - of - sample documents ) with a number of these alternative
123 a standard topic ( lda ) model
as mentioned earlier in the paper , there have been a number of other earlier ap - proaches to modeling document content are based on the idea that the probability distribution over words in a document can be expressed as a mixture of topics , where each topic is a probability distribution over words ( blei et al .
123; hofmann 123; ueda and saito 123; iyer and ostendorf 123 ) .
here we will focus on one such model|latent dirichlet allocation ( lda; blei et al .
( 123 ) ) . 123 in lda , the generation of a corpus is a three step process .
first , for each document , a distribu - tion over topics is sampled from a dirichlet distribution .
second , for each word in the document , a single topic is chosen according to this distribution .
finally , each word is sampled from a multinomial distribution over words speci ( cid : 123 ) c to the sampled
the parameters of this model are similar to those of the author topic model : ( cid : 123 ) represents a distribution over words for each topic , and ( cid : 123 ) represents a distribution over topics for each document .
using this notation , the generative process can be
123 : for each document d = 123; : : : ; d choose ( cid : 123 ) d ( cid : 123 ) dirichlet ( ( cid : 123 ) )
for each topic t = 123; : : : ; t choose ( cid : 123 ) t ( cid : 123 ) dirichlet ( ( cid : 123 ) )
123 : for each document d = 123; : : : ; d
for each word wdi , indexed by i = 123; : : nd
conditioned on d choose a topic zdi ( cid : 123 ) discrete ( ( cid : 123 ) d ) conditioned on zdi choose a word wdi ( cid : 123 ) discrete ( ( cid : 123 ) zdi )
a graphical model corresponding to this process is shown in figure 123 ( a ) .
latent dirichlet allocation is a special case of the author - topic model , corre - sponding to the situation in which each document has a unique author .
estimating ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) provides information about the topics that participate in a corpus and the weights of those topics in each document respectively .
however , this topic model
123the model we describe is actually the smoothed lda model with symmetric dirichlet priors ( blei et al .
123 ) as this is closest to the author - topic model .
acm transactions on information systems , vol .
n , march 123
learning author - topic models from text corpora
di ( cid : 123 ) erent generative models for documents .
provides no explicit information about the interests of authors : while it is infor - mative about the content of documents , authors may produce several documents| often with co - authors|and it is consequently unclear how the topics used in these documents might be used to describe the interests of the authors .
123 a simple author model
topic models illustrate how documents can be modeled as mixtures of probability distributions .
this suggests a simple method for modeling the interests of authors , namely where words in documents are modeled directly by author - word distribu - tions without any hidden latent topic variable , as originally proposed by mccallum ( 123 ) .
assume that a group of authors , ad , decide to write the document d .
for each word in the document an author is chosen uniformly at random , and a word is chosen from a probability distribution over words that is speci ( cid : 123 ) c to that author .
in this model , ( cid : 123 ) denotes the probability distribution over words associated with
each author .
the generative process is as follows :
123 : for each author a = 123; : : : ; a choose ( cid : 123 ) a ( cid : 123 ) dirichlet ( ( cid : 123 ) ) 123 : for each document d = 123; : : : ; d
given the set of authors ad for each word wdi , indexed by i = 123; : : nd
conditioned on ad choose an author xdi ( cid : 123 ) uniform ( ad ) conditioned on xdi choose a word wdi ( cid : 123 ) discrete ( ( cid : 123 ) xdi )
a graphical model corresponding to this generative process is shown in figure 123 ( b ) .
this model is also a special case of the author - topic model , corresponding to a situation in which there is a unique topic for each author .
when there is a single author per document , it is equivalent to a naive bayes model .
estimating ( cid : 123 ) provides information about the interests of authors , and can be used to answer queries about author similarity and authors who write on subjects similar to an observed document .
however , this author model does not provide any information
acm transactions on information systems , vol .
n , march 123
michal rosen - zvi et al .
about document content that goes beyond the words that appear in the document and the identities of authors of the document .
123 an author - topic model with fictitious authors
a potential weakness of the author - topic model is that it does not allow for any idiosyncratic aspects of a document .
the document is assumed to be generated by a mixture of the authors topic distributions and nothing else .
the lda model is in a sense at the other end of this spectrum|it allows each document to have its own document - speci ( cid : 123 ) c topic mixture .
in this context it is natural to explore models that lie between these two extremes .
one such model can be obtained by adding an additional unique \ ( cid : 123 ) ctitious " author to each document .
this ( cid : 123 ) ctitious author can account for topics and words that appear to be document - speci ( cid : 123 ) c and not accounted for by the authors .
the ( cid : 123 ) ctitious author mechanism in e ( cid : 123 ) ect provides the advantage of an lda element to the author - topic model .
in terms of the algorithm , the only di ( cid : 123 ) erence between the standard author - topic algorithm and the one that contains ( cid : 123 ) ctitious authors is that the number of authors is increased from a to a + d , and the number of authors per document ad is increased by 123|the time complexity of the algorithm increases accordingly .
one also has the option of putting a uniform distribution over authors ( including the ( cid : 123 ) ctitious author ) or allowing a non - uniform distribution over both true authors and the ( cid : 123 ) ctitious author .
123 comparing perplexity for di ( cid : 123 ) erent models
we compare the predictive power ( using perplexity ) of the models discussed in this section on the nips document set .
we divided the d = 123; 123 nips papers into a training set of 123 , 123 papers and a test set of 123 papers of which 123 are single - authored papers .
we chose the test data documents such that each author of a test set document also appears in the training set as an author .
for each model , we generated s = 123 chains from the gibbs sampler , each starting from a di ( cid : 123 ) erent initial conditions .
we kept the 123th sample from each chain and estimated the average perplexity using equation 123
for all models we ( cid : 123 ) xed the number of topics at t = 123 and used the same training set dtrain and test set .
the hyperparameter values were set in the same manner as in earlier experiments , i . e , in the lda model and the author - topic model ( cid : 123 ) = 123=t = 123 : 123 and ( cid : 123 ) = 123 : 123
the single hyperparameter of the author model was set to 123 : 123
in figure 123 we present the average perplexity as a function of the number of observed words from the test documents .
all models were trained on the training data and then a number of randomly selected words from the test documents ( in - dicated on the x - axis ) were used for further training and perplexity calculated on the remaining words .
in order to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm we approximated the posterior distributions by making use of the same monte - carlo chains for all derivations where for each point in the graph the chain is trained further only on the observed test words .
in the graph we present results for the author - topic model , the topic ( lda ) model , and the author - topic ( at ) model with ( cid : 123 ) ctitious authors .
the insert shows the author model and the author - topic model .
the author model ( insert ) has by far the worst performance|including latent topics signi ( cid : 123 ) cantly improves the predictive log - likelihood of such a model ( lower curve in the insert ) .
in the main plot , for relatively small numbers of observed

number of observed words
averaged perplexity as a function of observed words in the test documents .
the main plot shows results for the topic ( lda ) model , the author - topic ( at ) model , and the author - topic model with ( cid : 123 ) ctitious authors .
the insert shows results for the author model and author - topic
words ( up to 123 ) , the author - topic models ( with and without ( cid : 123 ) ctitious authors ) have lower perplexity than the lda model .
the lda model learns a topic mixture for each document in the training data .
thus , on a new document with zero or even just a few observed words , it is di ( cid : 123 ) cult for the lda model to provide predictions that are tuned to that document .
in contrast , the author - topic model performs better than lda with few ( or even zero ) words observed from a document , by making use of available the side - information about the authors of the document .
once enough words from a speci ( cid : 123 ) c document have been observed the predictive performance of the lda model improves since it can learn a more accurate predic - tive model for that speci ( cid : 123 ) c document .
above 123 observed words , on average , the author - topic model is not as accurate as the lda model since it does not have a document - speci ( cid : 123 ) c topic mixture that can be tuned to the speci ( cid : 123 ) c word distribution of the test document .
adding one ( unique ) ( cid : 123 ) ctitious author per document results in a curve that is systematically better than the author topic model ( without a ( cid : 123 ) ctitious author ) .
the ( cid : 123 ) ctitious author model is not quite as accurate as the lda ( topic ) model after 123 words or so ( on average ) .
this is intuitively to be expected : the presence of a ( cid : 123 ) ctitious author gives this model more modeling ( cid : 123 ) exibility com - pared to the author - topic model , but it is still more constrained than the lda model for a speci ( cid : 123 ) c document .

123 comparing information retrieval measures of the author - topic and standard
in this section , we describe an illustrative experiment to retrieve full text documents using document titles and author names .
we compare the performance of the author - topic model with a standard topic ( lda ) model ( from section 123 ) and a state - of - the - art tfidf approach .
finding documents similar to a query document is a well - known problem in information retrieval .
while there are a variety of approaches to ( cid : 123 ) nding similar documents when the full text of a query document is available , the problem is more challenging when only partial information about the query document is available ( e . g .
the title of the document or the list of authors ) .
for example , there are many documents listed in the citeseer data base for which only the titles and authors are available .
similarly , many older conferences only have titles and authors online , not full papers .
on this problem , we use the extended nips conference corpus ( years 123 - 123 ) 123
this data set contains d = 123 , 123 documents , a = 123 , 123 authors , and w = 123 , 123 unique words .
for each document , we include its set of authors as additional words so that lda and tfidf have the same information as the author - topic model .
class labels are available for documents from 123 to 123 and there are 123 such documents in the corpus .
there are 123 classes in this corpus corresponding to nips paper categories such as aa ( algorithms and architectures ) and n s ( neuroscience ) .
each labeled document is associated with one of these classes .
we obtained the titles of these documents from the nips conference proceedings website123
we divided this data set into query and retrieval sets with 123 and 123 , 123 documents respectively .
the query set was created by randomly selecting documents from the set of documents with class labels such that for each query document at least one of its authors is present in the retrieval set .
a query consists of words from the title of a document and its associated authors .
documents from the retrieval set with the same class label as the query document are judged to be relevant to the query document .
we ran s=123 di ( cid : 123 ) erent markov chains for the author - topic model and the lda model ( each with t=123 ) on the retrieval set , using the same parameters as described in section 123
for tfidf , we use the okapi bm123 method ( sparck jones et al .
123 ) where ,
given a query q , the score of a document d is given by
bm123 - score ( d; q ) = xw123q
x ( w; d ) ( k123 + 123 )
x ( w; d ) + k123 ( cid : 123 ) 123 ( cid : 123 ) b + b nd
idf ( w ) = log
d ( cid : 123 ) dw + 123 : 123
dw + 123 : 123
x ( w; d ) is the frequency of the query - word w in document d , nd is the number of words in document d , ( cid : 123 ) n is the mean value of nd across documents in the corpus , d is the total number of documents in the corpus , dw is the number of documents

in the corpus containing the word w , and k123 and b are free parameters .
we set k123 = 123 and b = 123 : 123 which is a popular setting for okapi bm123 ( robertson et al .
in the language modeling approach to information retrieval ( e . g . , ponte and croft ( 123 ) ) , queries can be matched to documents using the query likelihood model , where the similarity of a query q to a document d is measured by the probability of the words in the query q conditioned on the document d , p ( qjd ) .
for the author - topic model , we have
p ( qjd ) = yw123q " 123
xs=123 yw123q " 123
p ( wjt ) p ( tja ) #
e ( ( cid : 123 ) wtjzs; d; ( cid : 123 ) ) e ( ( cid : 123 ) tajxs; zs; d; ( cid : 123 ) ) #
where the expected values of ( cid : 123 ) wt and ( cid : 123 ) ta are estimated using equations 123 and 123 respectively .
similarly , for lda we have
p ( qjd ) = yw123q " t
p ( wjt ) p ( tjd ) #
which can be computed approximately using the lda model parameters learned from gibbs sampling ( analogous to the approximation in equation 123 ) .
note that the at model ( equation 123 ) is conditioning on the set of authors ad of the can - didate retrieval document d , whereas lda and tfidf treat authors as just addi - tional words .
this allows the at model to have a relatively wider distribution of probability mass in the topic distribution for a document ( as it can borrow topical information from multiple documents via the authors ) .
in other words , a document has a more peaked topic distribution in lda than in the at model .
so , when there is less information in a query ( as in this experiment where a query is restricted to the words in the title and the set of authors ) , the at model should have a better chance of matching to the query - word topics .
figure 123 ( top ) indicates that given just the titles and authors of query docu - ments , the at model is more accurate at retrieving documents than both the lda model and tfidf .
when the full - text of query documents is available ( figure 123 , bottom ) all the approaches improve in their accuracy and the performance of lda is now marginally better than that of the at model and tfidf .
this is consistent with what we know about the lda and at models : the lda model has more ( cid : 123 ) exibility in modeling a document once it sees enough words ( after the crossover point of 123 to 123 words in figure 123 ) .
in these experiments tfidf is used as a simple baseline .
in a practical setting one can likely get better precision - recall characteristics than any of the approaches shown here by combining a word - level re - trieval approach ( like tfidf or a multinomial - based document model ) with latent semantic matching approaches ( like lsa , lda , and at models ) ( wei and croft 123; chemudugunta et al .
123 ) .
the author - topic model proposed in this paper provides a relatively simple proba - bilistic model for exploring the relationships between authors , documents , topics ,
acm transactions on information systems , vol .
n , march 123
learning author - topic models from text corpora
and words .
this model provides signi ( cid : 123 ) cantly improved predictive power in terms of perplexity compared to a more impoverished author model , where the interests of authors are directly modeled with probability distributions over words .
when compared to the lda topic model , the author - topic model was shown to have more focused priors when relatively little is known about a new document , but the lda model can better adapt its distribution over topics to the content of individual documents as more words are observed .
the primary bene ( cid : 123 ) t of the author - topic model is that it allows us to explicitly include authors in document models , provid - ing a general framework for answering queries and making predictions at the level of authors as well as the level of documents .
we presented results of applying the author - topic model to large text corpora , including nips proceedings papers , citeseer abstracts , and enron emails .
poten - tial applications include automatic reviewer recommender systems where potential reviewers or reviewer panels are matched to papers based on the words expressed in a paper as well the names of the authors .
the author topic model could be incorporated in author identi ( cid : 123 ) cation systems to infer the identity of an author of a document not only on the basis of stylistic features , but also using the topics expressed in a document .
the underlying probabilistic model of the author - topic model is quite simple and ignores several aspects of real - word document generation that could be explored with more advanced generative models .
for example , as with many statistical models of language , the generative process does not make any assumption about the order of words as they appear in documents .
recent work , e . g . , gri ( cid : 123 ) ths et al .
( 123 ) and gruber et al .
( 123 ) present extensions of the lda model by relaxing the bag - of - words assumption and modeling the word sequence by hidden markov in gri ( cid : 123 ) ths et al .
( 123 ) an extension of the lda model is presented in which words are factorized into function words , handled by a hidden markov model ( hmm ) and content words handled by a topic model .
because these models automatically parse documents into content and non - content words , there is no need for a preprocessing stage where non - content words are ( cid : 123 ) ltered out using a prede ( cid : 123 ) ned stop - word list .

( 123 ) the natural ( cid : 123 ) ow of topics is learned by modeling markov dependencies between the hidden topics .
these hmm extensions could also be incorporated into the author - topic model to highlight parts of documents where content is expressed by particular authors .
beyond the authors of a document , there are several other sources of informa - tion that can provide opportunities to learn about the set of topics expressed in a document .
for example , for email documents mccallum et al .
( 123 ) propose an extension of the author topic model where topics are conditioned on both the sender as well as the receiver .
for scienti ( cid : 123 ) c documents we have explored simple extensions within the author - topic modeling framework to generalize the notion of an author to include any information source that might constrain the set of topics .
for example , one can rede ( cid : 123 ) ne ad to include not only the set of authors for a docu - ment but also the set of citations .
in this manner , words and topics expressed in a document can be associated with either an author or a citation .
these extensions are attractive because they do not require changes to the generative model .
the set of topics could also be conditioned on other information about the documents

( beyond authors and citations ) , such as the journal source , the publication year , and the institutional a ( cid : 123 ) liation of the authors .
an interesting direction for future work is to develop e ( cid : 123 ) cient generative models where the distribution over topics is conditioned jointly on all such sources of information .
appendix a : deriving the sampling equations for the author - topic model
in this section , we describe the derivation of the sampling equation , equation 123 , used to generate samples for the author - topic model .
in the author - topic model , the joint distribution of the set of word tokens in the corpus w , the set of topic assignments z , the set of author assignments x , the set of author mixtures ( cid : 123 ) , and the set of topic mixtures ( cid : 123 ) , given the dirichlet hyperparameters ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) , and the author set a , can be simpli ( cid : 123 ) ed as follows :
p ( w; z; x; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) j ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ; a ) = p ( w; z; xj ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ; a ) p ( ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) j ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) )

as a ( cid : 123 ) rst step in deriving the gibbs sampling equation for the author - topic model , we integrate out the random variables ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) from equation 123 , making use of the fact that the dirichlet distribution is a conjugate prior of multinomial distribution .
in this manner we can interpret the terms involving ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) in equation 123 as dirichlet distributions , as they have the same functional form .
the resulting dirichlet integrals are well - known ( e . g . ,

to obtain the gibbs sampling equation , we need to obtain an expression for p ( xdi = a; zdi = tjwdi = w; z ( cid : 123 ) di; x ( cid : 123 ) di; w ( cid : 123 ) di; a; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) .
from bayes theorem , we have
p ( xdi = a; zdi = tjwdi = w; z ( cid : 123 ) di; x ( cid : 123 ) di; w ( cid : 123 ) di; a; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ) /

where yi stands for all components of the vector y excluding the ith component .
setting w , z , x to w ( cid : 123 ) di , z ( cid : 123 ) di , x ( cid : 123 ) di respectively in equation 123 , we get
p ( w ( cid : 123 ) di; z ( cid : 123 ) di; x ( cid : 123 ) di; ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) j ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ; a ) =
where ad is the number of authors of the document d .
integrating over ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) in the above equation , in a manner analogous to that for equation 123 , we get
p ( w ( cid : 123 ) di; z ( cid : 123 ) di; x ( cid : 123 ) dij ( cid : 123 ) ; ( cid : 123 ) ; a ) = adconst " t

using the results from equations 123 , 123 , and 123; and the identity ( cid : 123 ) ( k + 123 ) = k ( cid : 123 ) ( k ) ; we obtain the following gibbs sampling equation for the author - topic model ( equa -

( for simplicity of notation we omitted terms that are implicitly conditioned on in the probabilities in this section , such as xs , zs , dtrain , ( cid : 123 ) ( cid : 123 ) and t ) .
we can also compute the probability that a novel word is authored by author xn +123 = a given that it is assigned to topic zn +123 = t , and given a sample from the posterior distribution , xs , zs .
the novel word is part of a new unobserved document that contains a single word and is authored by all authors in the corpus .
one can ( cid : 123 ) rst calculate the joint probability of the author assignment as well as the topic
p ( zn +123 = t; xn +123 = a ) = p ( zn +123 = tjxn +123 = a ) p ( xn +123 = a ) =

appendix c : interpreting models as matrix factorization
the relationships among the models discussed in section 123 can be illustrated by interpreting each model as a form of matrix factorization ( c . f .
lee and seung ( 123; canny ( 123 ) ) .
each model speci ( cid : 123 ) es a di ( cid : 123 ) erent scheme for obtaining a probability distribution over words for each document in a corpus .
these distributions can be assembled into a w ( cid : 123 ) d matrix p , where pwd is the probability of word w in document d .
in all three models , p is a product of matrices .
as shown in figure 123 , the models di ( cid : 123 ) er only in which matrices are used .
in the author - topic model , p is the product of three matrices : the w ( cid : 123 ) t matrix of distributions over words ( cid : 123 ) , the t ( cid : 123 ) a matrix of distributions over topics ( cid : 123 ) , and an a ( cid : 123 ) d matrix a , as shown in figure 123 ( a ) .
the matrix a expresses the uniform distribution over authors for each document , with aad taking value 123 if a 123 ad and zero otherwise .
the other models each collapse together one pair of matrices in this product .
in the topic model , ( cid : 123 ) and a are collapsed together into a single t ( cid : 123 ) d matrix ( cid : 123 ) , as shown in figure 123 ( b ) .
in the author model , ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) are collapsed together into a single w ( cid : 123 ) a matrix ( cid : 123 ) , as shown in figure 123 ( c ) .
under this view of the di ( cid : 123 ) erent models , parameter estimation can be construed as matrix factorization .

matrix factorization interpretation of di ( cid : 123 ) erent models .
( a ) the author - topic model ( b ) a standard topic model .
( c ) a simple author model .
the maximum - likelihood estimates for ( cid : 123 ) and ( cid : 123 ) is equivalent to minimizing the kullback - leibler divergence between p and the empirical distribution over words in each document .
the three di ( cid : 123 ) erent models thus correspond to three di ( cid : 123 ) erent schemes for constructing an approximate factorization of the matrix of empirical probabilities , di ( cid : 123 ) ering only in the elements into which that matrix is decomposed .
