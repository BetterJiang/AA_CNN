one of the central questions of cognitive development is how we learn so much from such
apparently limited evidence .
in learning about causal relations , reasoning about object
categories or their properties , acquiring language , or constructing intuitive theories ,
children routinely draw inferences that go beyond the data they observe .
probabilistic
models provide a general - purpose computational framework for exploring how a learner
might make these inductive leaps , explaining them as forms of bayesian inference .
this paper presents a tutorial overview of the bayesian framework for studying
cognitive development .
our goal is to provide an intuitive and accessible guide to
the what , the how , and the why of the bayesian approach : what sorts of problems
and data the framework is most relevant for , and how and why it may be useful for
developmentalists .
we consider three general inductive problems that learners face ,
each grounded in specic developmental challenges :
inductive generalization from examples , with a focus on learning the referents of
words for object categories .
acquiring inductive constraints , tuning and shaping prior knowledge from expe -
rience , with a focus on learning to learn categories .
learning inductive frameworks , constructing or selecting appropriate hypothesis
spaces for inductive generalization , with applications to acquiring intuitive theo -
ries of mind and inferring hierarchical phrase structure in language .
we also discuss several general issues as they bear on the use of bayesian models :
assumptions about optimality , biological plausibility , and what idealized models can tell
us about actual human minds .
the paper ends with an appendix containing a glossary
and a collection of useful resources for those interested in learning more .
123 bayesian basics :
inductive generalization from
the most basic question the bayesian framework addresses is how to update beliefs and
make inferences in light of observed data .
in the spirit of marrs ( 123 ) computational -
level of analysis , it begins with understanding the logic of the inference made when
generalizing from examples , rather than the algorithmic steps or specic cognitive pro -
cesses involved .
a central assumption is that degrees of belief can be represented as
probabilities : that our conviction in some hypothesis h can be expressed as a real num -
ber ranging from 123 to 123 , where 123 means something like h is completely false and 123
that h is completely true .
the framework also assumes that learners represent prob -
ability distributions and that they use these probabilities to represent uncertainty in
inference .
these assumptions turn the mathematics of probability theory into an engine
of inference , a means of weighing each of a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses h to determine which best explain the observed data .
probability theory
tells us how to compute the degree of belief in some hypothesis hi , given some data d .
computing degrees of belief as probabilities depends on two components
called the prior probability and denoted p ( hi ) , captures how much we believe in hi prior to observing the data d .
the other , called the likelihood and denoted p ( d|hi ) ,
captures the probability with which we would expect to observe the data d if hi were
these combine to yield the posterior probability of hi , given via bayes rule :
p ( hi|d ) =
p ( d|hi ) p ( hi ) hjh p ( d|hj ) p ( hj )
as we will see , the product of priors and likelihoods often has an intuitive interpretation .
it balances between a sense of plausibility based on background knowledge on one hand
and the data - driven sense of a suspicious coincidence on the other .
in the spirit
of ockhams razor , it expresses the tradeo between the intrinsic complexity of an
explanation and how well it ts the observed data .
the denominator in equation 123 provides a normalizing term which is the sum of
the probability of each of the possible hypotheses under consideration; this ensures that
bayes rule will reect the proportion of all of the probability that is assigned to any
single hypothesis hi , and ( relatedly ) that the posterior probabilities of all hypotheses
sum to one .
this captures what we might call the law of conservation of belief : a
rational learner has a xed mass of belief to allocate over dierent hypotheses , and the
act of observing data just pushes this mass around to dierent regions of the hypothesis
if the data lead us to strongly believe one hypothesis , we must decrease our
degree of belief in all other hypotheses .
by contrast , if the data strongly disfavor all
but one hypothesis , then ( to paraphrase sherlock holmes ) whichever remains , however
implausible a priori , is very likely to be the truth .
to illustrate how bayes rule works in practice , let us consider a simple application
with three hypotheses .
imagine you see your friend sally coughing .
what could explain
this ? one possibility ( call it hcold ) is that sally has a cold; another ( call it hcancer is
that she has lung cancer; and yet another ( call it hheartburn ) is that she has heartburn .
intuitively , in most contexts , hcold seems by far the most probable , and may even be the
only one that comes to mind consciously .
why ? the likelihood favors hcold and hcancer
over hheartburn , since colds and lung cancer cause coughing , while heartburn does not .
the prior , however , favors hcold and hheartburn over hcancer : lung cancer is thankfully rare ,
while colds and heartburn are common .
thus the posterior probability the product
of these two terms is high only for hcold .
the intuitions here should be fairly clear , but to illustrate precisely how bayes
rule can be used to back them up , it can be helpful to assign numbers . 123 let us set
the priors as follows : p ( hcold ) = 123 , p ( hheartburn ) = 123 , and p ( hcancer ) = 123
captures the intuition that colds are slightly more common than heartburn , but both are
123note that we have assumed that these are the only possible hypotheses , and that exactly one applies .
that is why the priors are much higher than the base rates of these diseases .
in a real setting , there would be many more diseases under consideration , and each would have much lower prior probability .
they would also not be mutually exclusive .
adding such details would make the math more complex but not change anything else , so for clarity of exposition we consider only the
signicantly more common than cancer .
we can set our likelihoods to be the following : p ( d|hcold ) = 123 , p ( d|hcancer ) = 123 , and p ( d|hheartburn ) = 123 .
this captures the
intuition that both colds and cancer tend to lead to coughing , and heartburn generally
does not .
plugging this into bayes rule gives :
p ( hcold|d ) =
p ( d|hcold ) p ( hcold ) + p ( d|hcancer ) p ( hcancer ) + p ( d|hheartburn ) p ( hheartburn )
p ( d|hcold ) p ( hcold )
( 123 ) ( 123 ) + ( 123 ) ( 123 ) + ( 123 ) ( 123 )
123 + 123 + 123
thus , the probability that sally is coughing because she has a cold is much higher than
the probability of either of the other two hypotheses we considered .
of course , these
inferences could change with dierent data or in a dierent context .
for instance , if the
data also included coughing up blood , chest pain , and shortness of breath , you might
start to consider lung cancer as a real possibility : the likelihood now explains that data
better than a cold would , which begins to balance the low prior probability of cancer
in the rst place .
on the other hand , if you had other information about sally e . g . ,
that she had been smoking two packs of cigarettes per day for 123 years then it might
raise the prior probability of lung cancer in her case .
bayes rule will respond to these
changes in the likelihood or the prior in a way that accords with our intuitive reasoning .
the bayesian framework is generative , meaning that observed data are assumed
to be generated by some underlying process or mechanism responsible for creating the
in the example above , data ( symptoms ) are generated by an underlying illness .
more cognitively , words in a language may be generated by a grammar of some sort , in
combination with social and pragmatic factors .
in a physical system , observed events
may be generated by some underlying network of causal relations .
the job of the learner
is to evaluate dierent hypotheses about the underlying nature of the generative process ,
and to make predictions based on the most likely ones .
a probabilistic model is simply
a specication of the generative processes at work , identifying the steps ( and associated
probabilities ) involved in generating data .
both priors and likelihoods are typically
describable in generative terms .
to illustrate how the nature of the generative process can aect a learners inference ,
consider another example , also involving illness .
suppose you observe that 123% of the
people around you are coughing .
is this a sign that a new virus is going around ? your
inference will depend on how those data were generated in this case , whether it is a
random sample ( composed , say , of people that you saw on public transport ) or a non -
random one ( composed of people you see sitting in the waiting room at the doctors
the data are the same 123% of people are coughing regardless of how it was
generated , but the inferences are very dierent : you are more likely to conclude that
a new virus is going around if you see 123% of people on the bus coughing .
a doctors
oce full of coughing people means little about whether a new virus is going around ,
since doctors oces are never full of healthy people .
how can the logic of bayesian inference , illustrated here with these medical exam -
ples , apply to problems like word and concept learning , the acquisition of language ,
or learning about causality or intuitive theories ? in these cases , there is often a huge
space of hypotheses ( possibly an innite one ) .
it may not be clear how the models in
question should be interpreted generatively , since they seem to delineate sets ( e . g . , the
set of instances in a concept , the set of grammatical sentences , or the set of phenomena
explained by a theory ) .
here we illustrate how bayesian inference works more generally
in the context of a simple schematic example .
we will build on this example throughout
the paper , and see how it applies and reects problems of cognitive interest .
our simple example , shown graphically in figure 123 , uses dots to represent individual
data points ( e . g . , words or events ) generated independently from some unknown process
( e . g . , a language or a causal network ) that we depict in terms of a region or subset of
space : the process generates data points randomly within its region , never outside .
just as each of the hypotheses in the medical example above ( i . e . , cold , heartburn ,
or cancer ) are associated with dierent data ( i . e . , symptoms ) , each hypothesis here
figure 123 : ( i ) example data and hypothesis .
graphical representation of data and one possible hypothesis about how those data were generated .
there are three hypotheses here , each corresponding to a single rectangle .
the black data points can only be generated by the solid or the dashed rectangle .
a new data point in position a might be generated if the dashed rectangle is correct , but not the solid or dotted one .
( ii ) some hypotheses in the hypothesis space for this example .
hypotheses consist of rectangles; some are well - supported by the data and some are not .
encodes a dierent idea about which subset of space the data are drawn from .
figure
123 ( i ) depicts three possible hypotheses , each consisting of a single rectangle in the space :
hsolid corresponds to the solid line , hdashed to the dashed line , and hdotted to the dotted
before seeing data , a learner might have certain beliefs about which hypothesis is
most likely; perhaps they believe that all are equally likely , or they have a bias to prefer
smaller or larger rectangles .
these prior beliefs , whatever they are , would be captured
in the prior probability of each hypothesis : p ( hsolid ) , p ( hdashed ) , and p ( hdotted )
dierent hypotheses also yield dierent predictions about what data one would expect
to see; in figure 123 ( i ) , the data are consistent with hsolid and hdashed , but not hdotted ,
since some of the points are not within the dotted rectangle .
this would be reected in their likelihoods; p ( d|hsolid ) and p ( d|hdashed ) would both be non - zero , but p ( d|hdotted )
would be zero .
bayesian inference can also yield predictions about about unobserved
for instance , one would only observe new data at position a if hdashed is correct , since p ( a|hsolid ) = 123 , but p ( a|hdashed ) > 123
in this sense , inferring the hypotheses most
likely to have generated the observed data guides the learner in generalizing beyond
the data to new situations .
the hypothesis space h can be thought of as the set of all possible hypotheses ,
dened by the structure of the problem that the learner can entertain .
figure 123 ( ii )
shows a possible hypothesis space for our example , consisting of all possible rectangles
in this space .
note that this hypothesis space is innite in size , although just a few
representative hypotheses are shown .
the hypothesis space is dened by the nature of the learning problem , and thus
provided to the learner a priori .
for instance , in our example , the hypothesis space
would be constrained by the range of possible values for the lower corner ( x and y ) ,
length ( l ) , and width ( w ) of rectangular regions .
such constraints need not be very
strong or very limiting : for instance , one might simply specify that the range of possible
values for x , y , l , and w lies between 123 and some extremely large number like 123 , or
be drawn from a probability distribution with a very long tail .
in this sense , the prior
probability of a hypothesis p ( hi ) is also given by a probabilistic generative process
a process operating one level up from the process indexed by each hypothesis that
generates the observed data points .
we will see below how these hypothesis spaces and
priors need not be built in , but can be constructed or modied from experience .
in our example the hypothesis space has a very simple structure , but because a
bayesian model can be dened for any well - specied generative framework , inference
can operate over any representation that can be specied by a generative process
includes , among other possibilities , probability distributions in a space ( appropriate
for phonemes as clusters in phonetic space ) ; directed graphical models ( appropriate
for causal reasoning ) ; abstract structures including taxonomies ( appropriate for some
aspects of conceptual structure ) ; objects as sets of features ( appropriate for catego -
rization and object understanding ) ; word frequency counts ( convenient for some types
of semantic representation ) ; grammars ( appropriate for syntax ) ; argument structure
frames ( appropriate for verb knowledge ) ; markov models ( appropriate for action plan -
ning or part - of - speech tagging ) ; and even logical rules ( appropriate for some aspects of
conceptual knowledge ) .
the appendix contains a detailed list of papers that use these
and other representations .
the representational exibility of bayesian models allows us to move beyond some
of the traditional dichotomies that have shaped decades of research in cognitive de -
velopment : structured knowledge vs .
probabilistic learning ( but not both ) , or innate
structured knowledge vs .
learned unstructured knowledge ( but not the possibility of
knowledge that is both learned and structured ) .
as a result of this exibility , tradi -
tional critiques of connectionism that focus on their inability to adequately capture
compositionality and systematicity ( e . g . , fodor & pylyshyn , 123 ) do not apply to
bayesian models .
in fact , there are several recent examples of bayesian models that
embrace language - like or compositional representations in domains ranging from causal
induction ( griths & tenenbaum , 123 ) to grammar learning ( perfors , tenenbaum ,
& regier , submitted ) to theory acquisition ( kemp , tenenbaum , niyogi , & griths ,
123 a case study : learning names for object categories
to illustrate more concretely how this basic bayesian analysis of inductive generalization
applies in cognitive development , consider the task a child faces in learning names for
object categories .
this is a classic instance of the problem of induction in cognitive
development , as many authors have observed .
even an apparently simple word like
dog can refer to a potentially innite number of hypotheses , including all dogs , all
labradors , all mammals , all animals , all pets , all four - legged creatures , all dogs except
chihuahuas , all things with fur , all running things , etc .
despite the sheer number of
possible extensions of the word , young children are surprisingly adept at acquiring the
meanings of words even when there are only a few examples , and even when there is
no systematic negative evidence ( markman , 123; bloom , 123 ) .
how do children learn word meanings so well , so quickly ? one suggestion is that in -
fants are born equipped with strong prior knowledge about what sort of word meanings
are natural ( carey , 123; markman , 123 ) , which constrains the possible hypotheses
considered .
for instance , even if a child is able to rule out part - objects as possible
figure 123 : schematic view of hypotheses about possible extensions considered by the learner in xu & tenenbaum ( 123 ) ; because the taxonomy is hierarchical , the hypothe - ses are nested within each other .
figure reproduced from xu & tenenbaum ( 123 ) .
extensions , she cannot know what level of a taxonomy the word applies : whether dog
actually refers to dogs , mammals , labradors , canines , or living beings .
one solution
would be to add another constraint the presumption that count nouns map preferen -
tially to the basic level in a taxonomy ( rosch , mervis , gray , johnson , & boyes - braem ,
this preference would allow children to learn names for basic - level categories ,
but would be counterproductive for every other kind of word .
xu and tenenbaum ( 123b ) present a bayesian model of word learning that oers
a precise account of how learners could make meaningful generalizations from one or a
few examples of a novel word .
this problem can be schematically depicted as in figure
123 : for concepts that are organized in a hierarchical taxonomy , labelled examples are
consistent with multiple dierent extensions .
for instance , a single label labrador
could pick out only labradors , but it could also pick out dogs , animals , or living things .
this problem is faced by a child who , shown one or many objects with a given label ,
must decide which hypothesis about possible extensions of the label is best .
intuitively ,
figure 123 : learning object words .
( i ) hypothesis space that is conceptually similar to that in figure 123 , now depicted as a two - dimensional dot diagram; hypotheses with higher probability are darker rectangles .
with one data point , many hypotheses have some support .
( ii ) with three examples , the most restrictive hypothesis is much more
we would expect that when given one object , a reasonable learner should not strongly
prefer any of the hypotheses that include it , though the more restricted ones might be
slightly favored .
if the learner were shown three examples , we would expect the most
closely - tting hypothesis to be much more strongly preferred .
for instance , given one
labrador as an example of a fep , it is unclear whether fep refers to labradors ,
dogs , mammals , or animals .
but if given three labradors as the rst three examples of
fep , it would be quite surprising a highly suspicious coincidence if fep in fact
referred to a much more general class such as all dogs .
the same problem is depicted more abstractly in the dot diagram in figure 123
perordinate hypotheses ( e . g . , animal ) are represented as larger rectangles .
sometimes
they fully enclose smaller rectangles ( corresponding to more subordinate hypotheses ) ,
just as the extension of animals includes all labradors .
sometimes they can also cross -
cut each other , just as the extension of pets includes many ( but not all ) labradors .
the smaller rectangles represent hypotheses with smaller extensions , and we can use
this to understand how bayesian reasoning captures the notion of a suspicious coin -
cidence , explaining the tendency to increasingly favor the smallest hypothesis that is
consistent with the data as the number of data points increases .
this ability emerges due to the likelihood p ( d|h ) , the probability of observing the
data d assuming hypothesis h is true .
in general , more restrictive hypotheses , corre -
sponding to smaller regions in the data space , receive more likelihood for a given piece
if a small hypothesis is the correct extension of a word , then it is not too
surprising that the examples occur where they do; a larger hypothesis could be consis -
tent with the same data points , but explains less well exactly why the data fall where
they do .
the more data points we observe falling in the same small region , the more
of a suspicious coincidence it would be if in fact the words extension corresponded to
a much larger region .
more formally , if we assume that data are sampled uniformly at random from all
cases consistent with the concept , then the probability of any single data point d con -
sistent with h is inversely proportional to the size of the region h picks out call this
the size of h .
this is why when there is one data point , as in figure 123 ( i ) , there is a
slight preference for the most restrictive ( smallest ) hypothesis; however , the preference
is only slight , because it could still easily have been generated by any of the hypothe -
ses that include it .
but if multiple data points are generated independently from the
concept , as in figure 123 ( ii ) , the likelihood of h with n consistent examples is inversely
proportional to the size of h , raised to the nth power .
thus the preference for smaller
consistent hypotheses over larger hypotheses increases exponentially with the number
of examples , and the most restrictive consistent hypothesis is strongly favored
assumption is often referred to as the size principle ( tenenbaum & griths , 123 ) .
the math behind the size principle is best understood concretely if we think about
the hypotheses as discrete subsets of possible objects we might observe , such as bags
of colored marbles , rather than as continuous regions such as rectangular regions in a
two - dimensional space .
suppose bag a contains two marbles ( a red and a green ) and
bag b contains three ( a red , a green , and a yellow ) .
the probability of pulling the red
marble out of bag a is 123
123 = 123 , since there are two possible marbles to choose from .
the probability of pulling the red marble out of bag b is 123
123 = 123 for similar reasons .
thus , if you know only that a red marble has been pulled out of a bag ( but not which
bag it is ) , you might have a weak bias to think that it was pulled out of bag a , which
123 = 123 times as likely as bag b .
now suppose that someone draws out the following series of marbles , shaking the
bag fully between each draw : red , green , red , green .
at this point most people would
be more certain that the bag is a .
the size principle explains why .
if the probability
of pulling one red ( or green ) marble from bag a is 123
123 , the probability of pulling that
specic series of marbles is 123
123 = 123
123 = 123 , since each draw is
independent .
by contrast , the probability of drawing those marbles from bag b is
123 = 123
123 = 123 .
this means that bag a is now 123
123 = 123 times
as likely as b .
in essence , the slight preference for the smaller bag is magnied over
many draws , since it becomes an increasingly unlikely coincidence for only red or green
marbles to be drawn if there is also a yellow one in there .
this can be magnied if
the number of observations increases still further ( e . g . , consider observing a sequence
of red , green , red , green , green , green , red , green , red , red , green ) or the relative size
of the bags changes ( e . g . , suppose the observations are still red , green , red , green , but
that the larger bag contains six marbles , each of a dierent color , rather than three ) .
in either case bag a is now preferred to bag b by over a factor of 123 , and there is little
doubt that the marbles were drawn from bag a .
in a similar way , a small hypothesis
makes more precise predictions; thus , if the data are consistent with those predictions ,
then the smaller hypothesis is favored .
the size principle explains how it is possible to make strong inferences based on very
few examples .
it also captures the notion of a suspicious coincidence : as the number
of examples increases , hypotheses that make specic predictions those with more
explanatory power tend to be favored over those that are more vague .
this provides
a natural solution to the no negative evidence problem : deciding among hypotheses
given positive - only examples .
as the size of the data set approaches innity , a bayesian
learner rejects larger or more overgeneral hypotheses in favor of more precise ones
limited amounts of data , the bayesian approach can make more subtle predictions , as
the graded size - based likelihood trades o against the preference for simplicity in the
the likelihood in bayesian learning can thus be seen as a principled quantitative
measure of the weight of implicit negative evidence one that explains both how and
when overgeneralization should occur .
the results of xu and tenenbaum ( 123b ) reect this idea .
adults and 123 - and
123 - year - old children were presented with 123 objects distributed across three dierent
superordinate categories ( animals , vegetables , and vehicles ) , including many basic - level
and subordinate - level categories within those .
subjects were then shown either one or
three labelled examples of a novel word such as fep , and were asked to pick out the
other feps from the set of objects .
both children and adults responded dierently
depending on how many examples they were given .
just as in figure 123 , with one
example , people and the model both showed graded generalization from subordinate
to superordinate matches .
by contrast , when given three examples , generalizations
became much sharper and were usually limited to the most restrictive level .
this also illustrates how assumptions about the nature of the generative process
aect the types of inferences that can be made .
we have seen that people tend show
restricted generalizations on the basis of three examples; however , this only if they
think the experimenter was choosing those examples sensibly ( i . e . , as examples of the
concept ) .
if people think the data were generated in some other way for instance , an -
other learner was asking about those particular pictures then their inferences change
( xu & tenenbaum , 123a ) .
in this case , the lack of non - labradors no longer reects
something the experimenter can control; though it is a coincidence , it is not a suspi -
cious one .
the data are the same , but the inference changes as the generative process
underlying the data changes .
in other words , the size principle applies in just those
cases where the generative process is such that data are generated from the concept
( or , more generally , hypothesis ) itself .
so far we have illustrated how bayesian inference can capture generalization from
just a few examples , the simultaneous learning of overlapping extensions , and the use
of implicit negative evidence .
all of these are important , but it is also true that we
have built in a great deal , including a restricted and well - specied hypothesis space .
very often , human learners must not make reasonable specic generalizations within a
set hypothesis space , they also much be able to make generalizations about what sort
of generalizations are reasonable .
we see an example of this in the next section .
123 acquiring inductive constraints
one of the implications of classic problems of induction is the need for generalizations
about generalizations , or inductive constraints , of some sort .
the core problem is how
induction is justied based on a nite sample of any kind of data , and the inevitable
conclusion is that there must be some kind of constraint that enables learning to occur .
nearly every domain studied by cognitive science yields evidence that children rely
on higher - level inductive constraints .
children learning words prefer to apply them
to whole objects rather than parts ( markman , 123 ) .
babies believe that agents are
distinct from objects in that they can move without contact ( spelke , phillips , & wood -
ward , 123 ) and act in certain ways in response to goals ( woodward , 123; gergely &
csibra , 123 ) .
confronted with evidence that childrens behavior is restricted in pre -
dictable ways , the natural response is to hypothesize the existence of innate constraints ,
including the whole object constraint ( markman , 123 ) core systems of object repre -
sentation , psychology , physics , and biology ( carey & spelke , 123; spelke & kinzler ,
123; carey , 123 ) , and so on .
given that they appear so early in development , it
seems sensible to postulate that these constraints are innate rather than learned .
however , it may be possible for inductive constraints to be learned , at least in some
for instance , consider the problem of learning that some features matter for
categorizing new objects while others should be ignored ( e . g . , nosofsky , 123 ) .
acquir -
ing higher - level abstract knowledge would enable one to make correct generalizations
about an object from a completely novel category , even after seeing only one example .
a wealth of research indicates that people are capable of acquiring this sort of knowl -
edge , both rapidly in the lab ( nosofsky , 123; perfors & tenenbaum , 123 ) and over
the course of development ( landau , smith , & jones , 123; l .
smith , jones , landau ,
gershko - stowe , & samuelson , 123 ) .
children also acquire other sorts of inductive
constraints over the course of development , including the realization that categories
may be organized taxonomically ( rosch , 123 ) , that some verbs occur in alternating
patterns and others dont ( e . g . , pinker , 123 ) or that comparative orderings should be
transitive ( shultz & vogel , 123 ) .
how can an inductive constraint be learned , and how might a bayesian framework
explain this ? is it possible to acquire an inductive constraint faster than the specic
hypotheses it is meant to constrain ? if not , how can we explain peoples learning in
some situations ? if so , what principles explain this acquisition ?
a familiar example of the learning of inductive constraints was provided by goodman
( 123 ) .
suppose we have many bags of colored marbles and discover by drawing samples
that some bags seem to have black marbles , others have white marbles , and still others
have red or green marbles .
every bag is uniform in color; no bag contains marbles of
more than one color .
if we draw a single marble from a new bag in this population
and observe a color never seen before say , purple it seems reasonable to expect that
other draws from this same bag will also be purple .
before we started drawing from
any of these bags , we had much less reason to expect that such a generalization would
the assumption that color is uniform within bags is a learned overhypothesis ,
an acquired inductive constraint .
the ability to infer such a constraint is not in itself
a solution to the ultimate challenges of induction; it rests on other , arguably deeper
assumptions that the new bag is like the previous bags we have seen in relevant
yet it is still a very useful piece of abstract knowledge that guides subsequent
generalizations and can itself be induced from experience .
we can illustrate a similar idea in the rectangle world by imagining a learner who
is shown the schematic data in figure 123 ( i ) .
having seen point a only , the learner has
no way to decide whether b or c is more likely to be in the same category or region as
figure 123 : learning higher - order information .
( i ) given point a , one cannot identify whether b or c is more likely .
( ii ) given additional data , a model that could learn higher - order information about hypotheses might favor regions that tend to be long , thin rectangles oriented along the y axis ( i . e . , regions for which the length l tends to be short , the width w tends to be long , and the location ( x and y coordinates ) can be nearly anywhere ) .
if this is the case , points a and b are probably within the same region , but a and c are not .
however , if the learner has also seen the data in figure 123 ( ii ) , they might infer both
rst - order and second - order knowledge about the data set .
first - order learning refers
to the realization that the specic rectangular regions constitute the best explanation
for the data points seen so far; second - order ( overhypothesis ) learning would involve
realizing that the regions tend to be long , thin , and oriented along the y - axis
as learning the how categories are organized helps children generalize from new items ,
this type of higher - order inference helps with the interpretation of novel data , leading
to the realization that point b is probably in the same region as a but point c is not ,
even though b and c are equidistant from a .
a certain kind of bayesian model , known as a hierarchical bayesian model ( hbm ) ,
can learn overhypotheses by not only choosing among specic hypotheses , but by also
making higher - order generalizations about those hypotheses .
as weve already seen , in
a non - hierarchical model , the modeler sets the range of the parameters that dene the
hypotheses .
in a hierarchical model , the modeler instead species hyperparameters
parameters dening the parameters and the model learns the range of the parameters
themselves .
so rather than being given that the range of each of the the lower corner
( x , y ) , length l , and width w values lies between 123 and 123 , a hierarchical model might
instead learn the typical range of each ( e . g . , that l tends to be short while w tends to
be long , as depicted in figure 123 ( ii ) ) while the modeler species the range of the ranges .
the idea of wiring in abstract knowledge at higher levels of hierarchical bayesian
models may seem reminiscent of nativist approaches , but several key features t well
with empiricist intuitions about learning .
the top level of knowledge in an hbm is
prespecied , but every level beneath that can be learned .
as one moves up the hierarchy ,
knowledge becomes increasingly abstract and imposes increasingly weak constraints on
the learners specic beliefs at the lower levels .
thus , a version of the model that
learns at higher levels builds in weaker constraints than a version that learns only at
lower levels .
by adding further levels of abstraction to an hbm while keeping pre -
specied parameters to a minimum , at the highest levels of the model , we can come
increasingly close to the classical empiricist proposal for the bottom - up , data - driven
origins of abstract knowledge .
although the precise mathematical details of any hbm are too complex to go into
detail here , we can give a simplied example designed to motivate how it might be
possible to learn on multiple levels simultaneously .
imagine you are faced with the
marble example described earlier .
we can capture this problem by saying that for each
bag b , you have to learn the distribution of colors in the bag : call this distribution b .
at the same time , you want to make two inferences about the sets of bags as a whole :
how uniform colors tend to be within bags ( call this ) and what sorts of colors exist
overall ( call this ) .
here , and are the hyperparameters of each of the b values ,
since how likely any particular bag is will depend on the higher - level assumptions about
bags : if you think , for instance , that colors tend to be uniform within bags , then a bag
with lots of marbles of dierent colors in it will be low probability relative to a bag
with only one .
we can use this fact to learn on the higher level as well .
a bayesian
model that sees three bags , all uniform in color , will search for the setting of , , and
that make the observed data most probable; this will correspond to values that
tend to favor uniformity within bags , and and values that capture the observed
color distributions .
the bayesian model learns these things simultaneously in the sense
that it seeks to maximize the joint probability of all of the parameters , not just the
this example is a simplied description of one of the existing hierarchical bayesian
models for category learning ( kemp , perfors , & tenenbaum , 123 ) ; there are sev -
eral other hbms for the same underlying problem ( navarro , 123; griths , sanborn ,
canini , & navarro , 123; heller , sanborn , & chater , 123 ) .
though they dier in
many particulars , what all of these models have in common is that they can perform
inference on multiple levels of abstraction .
when presented with data consisting of
specic objects and features , these models are capable of making generalizations about
the specic objects as well as the appropriate generalizations about categorization in
general .
for instance , children in an experiment by l .
smith et al .
( 123 ) were pre -
sented with four novel concepts and labels and acquired a bias to assume not only that
individual categories like chairs tend to be organized by shape , but also that categories
of solid artifacts in general are as well .
a hierarchical bayesian model can make the
same generalization on the basis of the same data ( kemp , perfors , & tenenbaum , 123 ) .
a surprising eect of learning in hierarchical models is that , quite often , the higher -
order abstractions are acquired before all of the specic lower - level details :
children acquire some categorization biases even before they have learned all categories ,
the model might infer parameter values such that l tends to be short and w tends to be
long , signicantly before the size and location of each rectangular region is learned with
precision .
this eect , which we might call the blessing of abstraction123 , is somewhat
counterintuitive .
why are higher - order generalizations like this sometimes easier for a
bayesian learner to acquire ?
one reason is that the higher - level hypothesis space is often smaller than the lower -
level ones .
as a result , the model has to choose between fewer options at the higher level ,
which may require less evidence .
in our rectangle example , the higher - level knowledge
123we thank noah goodman for this coinage .
may consist of only three options : l and w are approximately equal , l is smaller than
w , or w is smaller than l .
even if a learner doesnt know whether l is 123 units or 123
units long and w is 123 or 123 , it might be fairly obvious that l is smaller than w .
more generally , the higher - level inference concerns the lower - level hypothesis space
( and is therefore based on the data set as a whole ) , whereas the lower - level inference is
only relevant for specic data points .
a single data point is informative only about the
precise size and location of a single region .
however , it and every other single data
point is informative about all of the higher - level hypotheses .
there is , in eect , more
evidence available to the higher levels than the lower ones , and they can therefore be
learned quite quickly .
is there empirical evidence that people acquire higher - level abstract knowledge at
the same time as , or before , lower - level specic knowledge ? adult laboratory category
learning studies indicate that generalizations on the basis of abstract knowledge occurs
at least as rapidly as lower - level generalizations ( perfors & tenenbaum , 123 ) .
there is
also some indication that children show an abstract to concrete shift in both biological
knowledge ( simons & keil , 123 ) and categorization , tending to dierentiate global ,
super - ordinate categories before basic level kinds ( mandler & mcdonough , 123 )
infants have been shown to have the capacity to form overhypotheses given a small
amount of data , providing initial evidence that the mechanisms needed for rapidly
acquired inductive constraints exist early in development ( dewar & xu , in press ) .
there is also a great deal of research that demonstrates the existence of abstract
knowledge before any concrete knowledge has been acquired .
for instance , the core
knowledge research program suggests that before children learn about many specic
physical objects or mental states , they have abstract knowledge about physical objects
and intentional agents in general ( e . g . , spelke & kinzler , 123 ) .
the core knowledge
view suggests that the presence of this abstract knowledge so early in development , and
before the existence of specic knowledge , implies that the abstract knowledge must be
innate in some meaningful sense .
more broadly , the basic motivation for positing innate
constraints on cognitive development is that without these constraints , children would
be unable to infer the specic knowledge that they seem to acquire from the limited data
available to them .
what is critical to the argument is that some constraints are present
prior to learning some of the specic data , not that those constraints must be innate .
approaches to cognitive development that emphasize learning from data typically view
the course of development as a progressive layering of increasingly abstract knowledge
on top of more concrete representations; under such a view , learned abstract knowledge
would tend to come in after more specic concrete knowledge is learned , so the former
could not usefully constrain the latter .
this view is sensible in the absence of explanations that can capture how abstract
constraints could be learned together with ( or before ) the more specic knowledge they
are needed to constrain .
however , the hierarchical bayesian framework provides such
an explanation ( or , at minimum , evidence that such a thing is possible ) .
a model
with the capability of acquiring abstract knowledge of a certain form123 can identify
what abstract knowledge is best supported by the data by learning which values of
hyper - parameters ( like and ) are the most probable given the data seen so far
an abstract generalization like this can be acquired very early and can function as a
constraint on later acquisition of specic data , it may function eectively as if it were an
innate domain - specic constraint , even if it is in fact not innate and instead is acquired
by domain - general induction from data .
in sum , then , hierarchical bayesian models oer a valuable tool for exploring ques -
tions of innateness due to the ability to limit built - in knowledge to increasingly abstract
levels and thereby learn inductive constraints at other levels .
as we will see in the next
section , the bayesian framework is also a useful way of approaching these questions for
another reason their ability to evaluate the rational tradeo between the simplicity
of a hypothesis and its goodness - of - t to the evidence in the world .
because of this ,
bayesian learners can make inferences that otherwise appear to go beyond the amount
123see section for a more thorough discussion of how this degree of supervision is consistent with a
non - innatist perspective , and is in fact impossible to avoid in any model of learning .
of evidence available .
123 developing inductive frameworks
the hierarchical bayesian models described above explain the origins of inductive biases
and constraints by tuning priors in response to data observed from multiple settings
or contexts .
but the acquisition of abstract knowledge often appears more discrete or
qualitative more like constructing an appropriate hypothesis space , or selecting an ap -
propriate hypothesis space from a higher level hypothesis space of hypothesis spaces .
consider the theory theory view of cognitive development .
childrens knowledge
about the world is organized into intuitive theories with a structure and function anal -
ogous to scientic theories ( carey , 123; gopnik & meltzo , 123; karmilo - smith ,
123; keil , 123 ) .
the theory serves as an abstract framework that guides inductive
generalization at more concrete levels of knowledge , by generating a space of hypothe -
intuitive theories have been posited to underlie real - world categorization ( murphy
& medin , 123 ) , causal induction ( waldmann , 123; griths & tenenbaum , 123 ) ,
biological reasoning ( atran , 123; inagaki & hatano , 123; medin & atran , 123 ) ,
physical reasoning ( mccloskey , 123 ) and social interaction ( nichols & stich , 123;
wellman , 123 ) .
for instance , an intuitive theory of mind generates hypotheses about
how a specic agents behavior might be explained in particular situations candidate
