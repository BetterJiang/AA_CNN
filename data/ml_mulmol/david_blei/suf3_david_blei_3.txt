in his dix , we how how to do tic nal nce der the ker ion hat we can eak the bal ter tor nto a set of k ors 123 : k uch hat ach nal ion p ( k|x , z , k ) is in a ble ial ily :
p ( k|x , z , k ) = h ( k ) exp ( g ( x , z , k , ) t ( k ) ag ( g ( x , z , k , ) ) ) .
we ill ign ach k an ent nal ion so hat

tic nal nce
we ose ach q ( k ) to be in the ame ial ily as the ete nal p ( k|x , z , k ) ,

we oad h ( ) , t ( ) , and a ( ) so hat , for ple , q ( k ) = p ( k|x , z , k ) hen k = g ( x , z , k , ) .
the ral ter g ( x , z , k , ) ses nto two rms ,

the rst nds nly on the bal ers k and the ers ; the ond is a sum of n rms hat end on k , , and a gle cal ext ( xn , zn ) .
ing as in ion 123 , we ill ive the ral ent of the lbo ied by his del and ice of nal ion .
ing on a lar k , we can ite the lbo as
l = eq ( log p ( k|x , z , k ) ) eq ( log q ( k ) ) + nst .
= ( eq ( g ( x , z , k , ) ) k ) k ag ( k ) + ag ( k ) + nst .
the ent of l ith ect to k is hen
ag ( k ) ( eq ( g ( x , z , k , ) ) k ) ,
and the ral ent of l ith ect to k is
l = eq ( g ( x , z , k , ) ) k

we can use his isy ral ent tly as in ion 123
