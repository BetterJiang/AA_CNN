Abstract

We present a probabilistic kernel approach to ordinal regression based on Gaussian processes. A
threshold model that generalizes the probit function is used as the likelihood function for ordinal
variables. Two inference techniques, based on the Laplace approximation and the expectation prop-
agation algorithm respectively, are derived for hyperparameter learning and model selection. We
compare these two Gaussian process approaches with a previous ordinal regression method based
on support vector machines on some benchmark and real-world data sets, including applications of
ordinal regression to collaborative ﬁltering and gene expression analysis. Experimental results on
these data sets verify the usefulness of our approach.

Keywords: Gaussian processes, ordinal regression, approximate Bayesian inference, collaborative
ﬁltering, gene expression analysis, feature selection

1. Introduction

Practical applications of supervised learning frequently involve situations exhibiting an order among
the different categories, e.g. a teacher always rates his/her students by giving grades on their overall
performance. In contrast to metric regression problems, the grades are usually discrete and ﬁnite.
These grades are also different from the class labels in classiﬁcation problems due to the existence
of ranking information. For example, grade labels have the ordering F < D < C < B < A. This is
a learning task of predicting variables of ordinal scale, a setting bridging between metric regression
and classiﬁcation referred to as ranking learning or ordinal regression.

There is some literature about ordinal regression in the domain of machine learning. Kramer
et al. (2001) investigated the use of a regression tree learner by mapping the ordinal variables into
numeric values. However there might be no principled way of devising an appropriate mapping
function. Frank and Hall (2001) converted an ordinal regression problem into nested binary clas-
siﬁcation problems that encode the ordering of the original ranks, and then the results of standard
binary classiﬁers can be organized for prediction. Har-Peled et al. (2003) proposed a constraint
classiﬁcation approach for ranking problems based on binary classiﬁers. Cohen et al. (1999) con-
sidered general ranking problems in the form of preference judgements. Herbrich et al. (2000)
applied the principle of Structural Risk Minimization (Vapnik, 1995) to ordinal regression lead-
ing to a new distribution-independent learning algorithm based on a loss function between pairs of
ranks. Shashua and Levin (2003) generalized the formulation of support vector machines to or-

dinal regression and the numerical results they presented shows a signiﬁcant improvement on the
performance compared with the on-line algorithm proposed by Crammer and Singer (2002).

In the statistics literature, most of the approaches are based on generalized linear models (Mc-
Cullagh and Nelder, 1983). The cumulative model (McCullagh, 1980) is well-known in classical
statistical approaches for ordinal regression, in which they rely on a speciﬁc distributional assump-
tion on the unobservable latent variables and a stochastic ordering of the input space. Johnson and
Albert (1999) described Bayesian inference on parametric models for ordinal data using sampling
techniques. Tutz (2003) presented a general framework for semiparametric models that extends
generalized additive models (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990) by incorporating nonparametric parts.
The nonparametric components of the regression model are ﬁtted by maximizing penalized log
likelihood, and model selection is carried out using AIC.

Gaussian processes (O’Hagan, 1978; Neal, 1997) have provided a promising non-parametric
Bayesian approach to metric regression (Williams and Rasmussen, 1996) and classiﬁcation prob-
lems (Williams and Barber, 1998). The important advantage of Gaussian process models (GPs) over
other non-Bayesian models is the explicit probabilistic formulation. This not only provides prob-
abilistic predictions but also gives the ability to infer model parameters such as those that control
the kernel shape and the noise level. The GPs are also different from the semiparametric approach
of Tutz (2003) in several ways. First, the additive models (Fahrmeir and Tutz, 2001) are deﬁned by
functions in each input dimension, whereas the GPs can have more general non-additive covariance
functions; second, the kernel trick allows to use inﬁnite basis function expansions; third, the GPs
perform Bayesian inference in the space of the latent functions.

In this paper, we present a probabilistic kernel approach to ordinal regression in Gaussian pro-
cesses. We impose a Gaussian process prior distribution on the latent functions, and employ an
appropriate likelihood function for ordinal variables which can be regarded as a generalization of
the probit function. Two Bayesian inference techniques are applied to implement model adapta-
tion by using the Laplace approximation (MacKay, 1992) and the expectation propagation (Minka,
2001) respectively. Comparisons of the generalization performance against the support vector ap-
proach (Shashua and Levin, 2003) on some benchmark and real-world data sets, such as movie
ranking and gene expression analysis, verify the usefulness of this approach.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we describe the Bayesian framework in Gaus-
sian processes for ordinal regression; in Section 3, we discuss the Bayesian techniques for hyperpa-
rameter inference; in Section 4, we present the predictive distribution for probabilistic prediction; in
Section 5, we give some extensive discussion on these techniques; in Section 6, we report the results
of numerical experiments on some benchmark and real-world data sets; we conclude this paper in
Section 7.

2. Bayesian Framework
Consider a data set composed of n samples. Each of the samples is a pair of input vector xi ∈ R d
and the corresponding target yi ∈ Y where Y is a ﬁnite set of r ordered categories. Without loss
of generality, these categories are denoted as consecutive integers Y = {1,2, . . . , r} that keep the
known ordering information. The main idea is to assume an unobservable latent function f (xi) ∈ R
associated with xi in a Gaussian process, and the ordinal variable yi dependent on the latent function
f (xi) by modelling the ranks as intervals on the real line. A Bayesian framework is described with
more details in the following.

GAUSSIAN PROCESSES FOR ORDINAL REGRESSION

2.1 Gaussian Process Prior
The latent functions { f (xi)} are usually assumed as the realizations of random variables indexed
by their input vectors in a zero-mean Gaussian process. The Gaussian process can then be fully
speciﬁed by giving the covariance matrix for any ﬁnite set of zero-mean random variables { f (xi)}.
The covariance between the functions corresponding to the inputs xi and x j can be deﬁned by Mercer
kernel functions (Wahba, 1990; Sch¨olkopf and Smola, 2001), e.g. Gaussian kernel which is deﬁned
as

2.2 Likelihood for Ordinal Variables

The likelihood is the joint probability of observing the ordinal variables given the latent functions,
denoted as P (D| f ) where D denotes the target set {yi}. Generally, the likelihood can be evaluated
as a product of the likelihood function on individual observation:

P (D| f ) =

n(cid:213)

i=1

P (yi| f (xi))

where the likelihood function P (yi| f (xi)) could be intuitively deﬁned as

be further deﬁned as b j = b1 + (cid:229)
role of b1 < b2 < . . . < br−1 is to divide the real line into r contiguous intervals; these intervals map
the real function value f (xi) into the discrete variable yi while enforcing the ordinal constraints.
The likelihood function (4) is used for ideally noise-free cases.
In the presence of noise from
inputs or targets, we may explicitly assume that the latent functions are contaminated by a Gaussian
noise with zero mean and unknown variance s 2.2 N (d ; µ,s 2) is used to denote a Gaussian random
variable d with mean µ and variance s 2 henceforth. Then the ordinal likelihood function becomes

function.

next section, we discuss techniques for hyperparameter learning.

3. Model Adaptation
In a full Bayesian treatment, the hyperparameters q must be integrated over the q -space. Monte
Carlo methods (Neal, 1997) can be adopted here to approximate the integral effectively. However
these might be prohibitively expensive to use in practice. Alternatively, we consider model se-
lection by determining an optimal setting for q
. The optimal values of hyperparameters q can be
simply inferred by maximizing the posterior probability P (q |D), where P (q |D) (cid:181) P (D|q )P (q ).
The prior distribution on the hyperparameters P (q ) can be speciﬁed by domain knowledge, or al-
ternatively some vague uninformative distribution. The evidence is given by a high dimensional
integral, P (D|q ) = R P (D| f )P ( f ) d f . A popular idea for computing the evidence is to approxi-
mate the posterior distribution P ( f|D) as a Gaussian, and then the evidence can be calculated by an
explicit formula (MacKay, 1992; Csat´o et al., 2000; Minka, 2001). In this section, we describe two
Bayesian techniques for model adaptation by using the Laplace approximation and the expectation
propagation respectively.

3.1 MAP Approach with Laplace Approximation

The evidence can be calculated analytically after applying the Laplace approximation at the max-
imum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, and gradient-based optimization methods can then be used to
infer the optimal hyperparameters by maximizing the evidence. The MAP estimate on the latent
functions is referred to f MAP = argmax f P ( f|D), which is equivalent to the minimizer of negative
logarithm of P ( f|D), i.e.

S ( f ) =

where `(yi, f (xi)) = −ln P (yi| f (xi)) is known as the loss function. Note that

given as in (7).
Thus, this is a convex programming problem with a unique solution.3 The Laplace approximation
of S ( f ) refers to carrying out the Taylor expansion at the MAP point and retaining the terms up
to the second order (MacKay, 1992). Since the ﬁrst order derivative with respect to f vanishes at
f MAP, S ( f ) can also be written as

where L MAP denotes the matrix L

terior distribution P ( f|D) as a Gaussian distribution centered on f MAP with the covariance matrix

(S −1 + L MAP)−1, i.e. P ( f|D) ≈ N ( f ; f MAP, (S −1 + L MAP)−1). Using the Laplace approximation

P (D|q ) =

Z f Z exp(−S ( f )) d f ≈ exp(−S ( f MAP))|I + S

where I is an n× n identity matrix. The gradients of the logarithm of the evidence (11) with respect
to the hyperparameters q can be derived analytically. Then gradient-based optimization methods
can be employed to search for the maximizer of the evidence. Refer to Appendix A for the detailed
gradient formulae and the outline of our algorithm for model adaptation.

3.2 Expectation Propagation with Variational Methods

The expectation propagation algorithm (EP) is an approximate Bayesian inference method (Minka,
2001), which can be regarded as an extension of assumed-density-ﬁlter (ADF). The EP algorithm
has been applied in Gaussian process classiﬁcation along with variational methods for model selec-
tion (Seeger, 2002; Kim and Ghahramani, 2003). In the setting of Gaussian processes, EP attempts
to approximate P ( f|D) as a product distribution in the form of Q( f ) = (cid:213)
n
i=1 ˜ti( f (xi))P ( f ) where
˜ti( f (xi)) = si exp(− 1
2 pi( f (xi)− mi)2). The parameters {si, mi, pi} in {˜ti} are successively optimized
by minimizing the following Kullback-Leibler divergence,

Q( f )
˜told
i

˜ti(cid:19) .

(12)

P (yi| f (xi))(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

Since Q( f ) is in the exponential family, this minimization can be simply solved by moment match-
ing up to the second order. A detailed updating scheme can be found in Appendix B. At the
equilibrium of Q( f ), we obtain an approximate posterior distribution as P ( f|D) ≈ N ( f ; (S −1 +
P )−1P m, (S −1 +P )−1) where P
is a diagonal matrix whose ii-th entry is pi and m = [m1, m2, . . . , mn]T .
Variational methods can be used to optimize the hyperparameters q by maximizing the lower

bound on the logarithm of the evidence. By applying Jensen’s inequality, we have

log P (D|q ) = logR P (D| f )P ( f )
= R Q( f )log P (D| f )d f +R Q( f )log P ( f )d f −R Q( f )logQ( f )d f = F (q ).

Q( f ) Q( f )d f ≥ R Q( f )log P (D| f )P ( f )

Q( f )

d f

(13)

The lower bound F (q ) can be written as an explicit expression at the equilibrium of Q( f ), and then
the gradients with respect to q can be derived by neglecting the possible dependency of Q( f ) on q
.
The detailed formulation can be found in Appendix C.

4. Prediction

We have described two techniques, the MAP approach and the EP approach, to infer the optimal
model. At the optimal hyperparameters we inferred, denoted as q ∗, let us take a test case x for
which the target yx is unknown. The latent variable f (x) and the column vector f containing the n
zero-mean random variables { f (xi)}n
i=1 have the prior joint multivariate Gaussian distribution, i.e.

GAUSSIAN PROCESSES FOR ORDINAL REGRESSION

where k = [K (x, x1), K (x, x2), . . . , K (x, xn)]T . The conditional distribution of f (x) given f is a
Gaussian too, denoted as P ( f (x)| f ,q ∗) with mean f T S −1k and variance K (x, x)− kT S −1k. The
predictive distribution of P ( f (x)|D,q ∗) can be computed as an integral over f -space, which can be

written as

P ( f (x)|D,q ∗) = Z P ( f (x)| f ,q ∗)P ( f |D,q ∗) d f .

(14)

The posterior distribution P ( f|D,q ∗) can be approximated as a Gaussian by the MAP approach or
the EP approach (refer to Section 3). The predictive distribution (14) can then be simpliﬁed as a
Gaussian N ( f (x); µx,s 2

5. Discussion

In the MAP approach, the mean of the predictive distribution depends on the MAP estimate f MAP,
which is unique and can be found by solving a convex programming problem. Evidence maximiza-
tion is useful if the Laplace approximation around the mode point f MAP gives a good summary of
the posterior distribution P ( f|D). While in the approach of expectation propagation, the mean of
the predictive distribution depends on the approximate mean of the posterior distribution. When
the true shape of P ( f|D) is far from a Gaussian centered on the mode, the EP approach can have
a great advantage over the Laplace approximation. However the EP algorithm cannot guarantee
convergence, though it usually works well in practice.

, the inversion of the matrix S

The gradient-based optimization method usually requests evidence evaluation at tens of different
settings of q before the minimum is found. For each q
is required that
costs time at O(n3), where n is the number of training samples. Recently, Csat´o and Opper (2002)
proposed a fast training algorithm for Gaussian processes in which the set of basis vectors are
determined on-line for sparse representation. Lawrence et al. (2003) proposed a greedy selection
with criteria based on information-theoretic principles for sparse Gaussian processes (Seeger, 2003).
Tresp (2000) proposed the Bayesian committee machines to divide and conquer large data sets,
while using inﬁnite mixtures of Gaussian Processes (Rasmussen and Ghahramani, 2002) is another
promising technique. These algorithms can be applied directly in the settings of ordinal regression
for speedup.

Feature selection is an essential part in modelling. In Gaussian processes, the automatic rele-
vance determination (ARD) method proposed by MacKay (1994) and Neal (1996) can be embedded

1025

CHU AND GHAHRAMANI

into the covariance function (1) as follows:

Cov[ f (xi), f (x j)] = K (xi, x j) = exp −

2

d(cid:229)
V =1

V (x

i − x

j)2!

(17)

where k
V > 0 is the ARD parameter.4 The gradients with respect to the variables {lnk
V } can also
be derived analytically for model adaptation. The optimal value of the ARD parameter k
indicates
the relevance of the V -th input feature to the target. The form of feature selection we use here
results in a type of feature weighting. Furthermore, the linear combination of heterogeneous kernels
with positive coefﬁcients is still a valid covariance function. Lanckriet et al. (2004) suggest to
learn the kernel matrix with semideﬁnite programming. In the Bayesian framework, these positive
coefﬁcients for kernels could be treated as hyperparameters, and optimized using the evidence as a
criterion for optimization.

Note that binary classiﬁcation is a special case of ordinal regression with r = 2, and the like-
lihood function (5) becomes the probit function when r = 2. Both of the probit function and the
logistic function can be used as the likelihood function in binary classiﬁcation, while they have
different origins. Due to the dichotomous nature in the classes of multi-classiﬁcation, discriminant
functions are constructed for each class and then compete again others via the softmax function to
determine the likelihood. The logistic function, as a special case of the softmax function, comes
from general classiﬁcation problems.

In metric regression, warped Gaussian processes (Snelson et al., 2004) assume that there is
a nonlinear, monotonic, and continuous warping function relating the observed targets and some
latent variables in a Gaussian process. The warping function, which is learned from the data, can be
thought of as a pre-processing transformation applied before modelling with a Gaussian process. A
different (and very common) approach to dealing with this preprocessing is to discretize the target
values into r different bins. These discrete values are clearly ordinal, and applying ordinal regression
to these discrete values seems the natural choice. Interestingly, as the number of discretization bins
r is increased, the ordinal regression model becomes very similar to the warped Gaussian processes
model. In particular, by varying the thresholds in our ordinal regression model, it can approximate
any continuous warping function.

6. Numerical Experiments

We start this section with a simple synthetic data set to visualize the behavior of these algorithms,
and report the experimental results on sixteen benchmark data sets.5 Then we perform experiments
on a collaborative ﬁltering problem using the “EachMovie” data, and on Gleason score prediction
from gene microarray data related to prostate cancer. Shashua and Levin (2003) generalized the sup-
port vector formulation by ﬁnding multiple thresholds to deﬁne parallel discriminant hyperplanes
for ordinal scales, and reported that the performance of the support vector approach is better than
that of the on-line algorithm (Crammer and Singer, 2002). The problem size in the large-margin
ranking algorithm of Herbrich et al. (2000) is a quadratic function of the training data size making
the algorithmic complexity O(n4)–O(n6). This makes the experiments on large data sets computa-
tionally difﬁcult. Thus, we decide to limit our comparisons to the support vector approach (SVM)

4. These ARD parameters control the covariance length-scale of the Gaussian process along each input dimension.

of Shashua and Levin (2003) and the two versions of our approach, the MAP approach with Laplace
approximation (MAP) and the EP algorithm with variational methods (EP). In our implementation,6
we used the routine L-BFGS-B (Byrd et al., 1995) as the gradient-based optimization package, and
started from the initial values of hyperparameters to infer the optimal values in the criterion of the
approximate evidence (11) for MAP or the variational lower bound (13) for EP respectively.7 The
improved SMO algorithm (Keerthi et al., 2001) was adapted to implement the SVM approach (refer
to Chu and Keerthi (2005) for detailed description and extensive discussion),8 and 5-fold cross vali-
dation was used to determine the optimal values of model parameters (the kernel parameter k and the
regularization factor C) involved in the problem formulations. The initial search was done on a 7×7
k ≤ 3},
coarse grid linearly spaced in the region {(log10C,log10
k )
followed by a ﬁne search on a 9 × 9 uniform grid linearly spaced by 0.2 in the (log10C,log10
space. We have utilized two evaluation metrics which quantify the accuracy of predictive ordinal
scales { ˆy1, . . . , ˆyt} with respect to true targets {y1, . . . , yt}:

6.1 Artiﬁcial Data

Figure 2 presents the behavior of the three algorithms using the Gaussian kernel (1) on a synthetic
2D data with three ordinal scales.
In the support vector approach, the optimal thresholds were
determined by the SMO algorithm and 5-fold cross validation was used to decide the optimal values
of the kernel parameter and the regularization factor. As for the Gaussian process algorithms, model
adaptation (see Section 3) was used to determine the optimal values of the kernel parameter, the
noise level and the thresholds automatically. The ﬁgure shows that all the algorithms are working
reasonably well on this task.

6.2 Benchmark Data

We collected nine benchmark data sets (Set I in Table 1) that were used for metric regression prob-
lems. The target values were discretized into ordinal quantities using equal-length binning. These
bins divide the range of target values into a given number of intervals that are of same length. The
resulting rank values are ordered, representing these intervals of the original metric quantities. For
each data set, we generated two versions by discretizing the target values into ﬁve and ten intervals
respectively. We randomly partitioned each data set into training/test splits as speciﬁed in Table 1.
The partition was repeated 20 times independently. The Gaussian kernel (1) was used in these three
algorithms. The test results are recorded in Tables 2 and 3. The performance of the MAP and EP
approaches are closely matching. Our Gaussian process algorithms often yield better results than

the support vector approach on the average value, especially when the number of training samples
is small.

In the next experiment, we selected seven very large metric regression data sets (Set II in Table
1). The input vectors were normalized to zero mean and unit variance coordinate-wise. The target
values of these data sets were discretized into 10 ordinal quantities using equal-frequency binning.
For each data set, a small subset was randomly selected for training and then tested on the remaining
samples, as speciﬁed in Table 1. The partition was repeated 100 times independently. To show the
advantage of explicitly modelling the ordinal nature of the targets, we also employed the standard
Gaussian process algorithm (Williams and Rasmussen, 1996) for metric regression (GPR)9 to tackle
these ordinal regression tasks, where the ordinal targets were naively treated as continuous values
and the predictions for test cases were rounded to the nearest ordinal scale. The Gaussian kernel
(1) was used in the four algorithms. From the test results in Table 4, the ordinal regression algo-

rithms are clearly superior to the naive approach of applying standard metric regression. We also
observed that the performance of Gaussian process algorithms are signiﬁcantly better than that of
the support vector approach on six of the seven data sets. This veriﬁes our judgement in the previous
experiment that our Gaussian process algorithms yield better performance than the support vector
approach on small data sets. Although the EP approach often yields better results of mean zero-one
error than the MAP approach on these tasks, we have not detected any statistically signiﬁcant dif-
ference on their performance. In Table 4 we also report their negative logarithm of the likelihood in
prediction (NLL). The performance of the MAP and EP approaches are closely matching too with
no statistically signiﬁcant difference.

For these data sets, the overall training time of MAP and EP approaches was substantially less
than that of the SVM approach. This is because the MAP and EP approaches can tune the model
parameters by gradient descent that usually required evidence evaluations at tens of different settings
of q
, whereas k-fold cross validation for the SVM approach required evaluations at 130 different
nodes of q on the grid for every fold. For larger data sets, the SVM approach may still have an
advantage on training time due to the sparseness property in its computation.

GAUSSIAN PROCESSES FOR ORDINAL REGRESSION

6.3 Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative ﬁltering exploits correlations between ratings across a population of users. The goal
is to predict a person’s rating on new items given the person’s past ratings on similar items and the
ratings of other people on all the items (including the new item). The ratings are ordered, making
collaborative ﬁltering an ordinal regression problem. We carried out ordinal regression on a subset
of the EachMovie data (Compaq, 2001).10 The rates given by the user with ID number “52647”
on 449 movies were used as the targets, in which the numbers of zero-to-ﬁve star are 40, 20, 57,
113, 145 and 74 respectively. We selected 1500 users who contributed the most ratings on these
449 movies as the input features. The ratings given by the 1500 users on each movie were used as
the input vector accordingly. In the 449× 1500 input matrix, about 40% elements were observed.
We randomly selected a subset with size {50,100, . . . ,300} of the 449 movies for training, and
then tested on the remaining movies. At each size, the random selection was carried out 20 times
independently.

Pearson correlation coefﬁcient is the most popular correlation measure (Basilico and Hofmann,
2004), which corresponds to a dot product between normalized rating vectors. For instance, if
applied to the movies, we can deﬁne the so-called z-scores as
r(v, u)− µ(v)

z(v, u) =

s (v)

where u indexes users, v indexes movies, and r(v, u) is the rating on the movie v given by the user
u. µ(v) and s (v) are the movie-speciﬁc mean and standard deviation respectively. This correlation
coefﬁcient, deﬁned as

K (v, v0) = (cid:229)

z(v, u)z(v0, u)

u

where (cid:229) u denotes summing over all the users, was used as the covariance/kernel function in our
experiments for the three algorithms. As not all ratings are observed in the input vectors, we con-
sider two ad hoc strategies to deal with missing values: mean imputation and weighted low-rank
approximation. In the ﬁrst case, unobserved values are identiﬁed with the mean value, that means
their corresponding z-score is zero. In the second case, we applied the EM procedure described
by Srebro and Jaakkola (2003) to ﬁll in the missing data with the estimate. In the input matrix,
observed elements were weighted by one and missing data were given weight zero. The low rank
was ﬁxed at 2. In Figure 3, we present the test results of the two cases at different training data
size. Using mean imputation, SVM produced a bit more accurate results than Gaussian processes
on mean absolute error. In the cases with low rank approximation as preprocessing, the performance
of the three algorithms are highly competitive, and more interestingly, we observed about 0.08 im-
provement on mean absolute error for all the three algorithms. A serious treatment on the missing
data could be an interesting research topic for future work.

6.4 Gene Expression Analysis

Gleason score from the gene expression data is thus a typical ordinal regression problem. Since
only 6 samples had a score greater than 7, we merged them as the top level, leading to three levels
{= 6, = 7,≥ 8} with 26, 20 and 6 samples respectively. We randomly partitioned the data into 2
folds for training and test and repeated this partitioning 20 times independently. An ARD linear
kernel K (xi, x j) = (cid:229) dV =1
j was used to evaluate feature relevance. These ARD parameters
{k
V } were optimized by evidence maximization. According to the optimal values of these ARD
parameters, the genes were ranked from irrelevant to relevant. We then removed the irrelevant
genes gradually based on the rank list. The gene number was reduced from 12600 to 1. At each
number of selected genes, a linear kernel K (xi, x j) = (cid:229) dV =1 x
j was used in the three algorithms for

a fair comparison. Figure 4 presents the test results of the three algorithms for different numbers of
selected genes. We observed great and steady improvement using the subset of genes selected by
the ARD technique. The best validation output is achieved around 40 top-ranked features. In this
case, with only 26 training samples, the Bayesian approaches perform much better than the SVM,
and the EP approach is generally better than the MAP approach but the difference is not statistically
signiﬁcant.

7. Conclusion

Ordinal regression is an important supervised learning problem with properties of both metric re-
gression and classiﬁcation. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet novel nonparametric Bayesian
approach to ordinal regression based on a generalization of the probit likelihood function for Gaus-
sian processes. Two approximate inference procedures were derived in detail for evidence evalua-
tion and model adaptation. The approach intrinsically incorporates ARD feature selection and pro-
vides probabilistic prediction. The existent fast algorithms for Gaussian processes can be adapted
directly to tackle relatively large data sets. Experiments on benchmark and real-world data sets show
that the generalization performance is competitive and often better than support vector methods.

GAUSSIAN PROCESSES FOR ORDINAL REGRESSION

Initialization choose a favorite gradient-descent optimization package

select the starting point q

for the optimization package

Looping while the optimization package requests evidence/gradient evaluation at q

1. ﬁnd the MAP estimate by solving the convex programming problem (9)
2. evaluate the negative logarithm of the evidence (18) at the MAP
3. calculate the gradients with respect to q
4. feed the evidence and gradients to the optimization package

(18)–(18)

Exit Return the optimal q

found by the optimization package

Table 5: The outline of our algorithm for model adaptation using the MAP approach with Laplace

approximation.

We usually collect {lnk ,lns

r−1} as the set of variables to tune. This deﬁnition of
tunable variables is helpful to convert the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained
optimization problem. The outline of our algorithm for model adaptation is described in Table 5.

Appendix B. Approximate Posterior Distribution by EP
The expectation propagation algorithm attempts to approximate P ( f|D) in form of a product of
Gaussian distributions Q( f ) = (cid:213)
2 pi( f (xi)− mi)2). The
updating scheme is given as follows.

i=1 ˜t( f (xi))P ( f ) where ˜t( f (xi)) = si exp(− 1

n

The initial states:

• individual mean mi = 0 ∀i ;
• individual inverse variance pi = 0 ∀i ;
• individual amplitude si = 1 ∀i ;
• posterior covariance A = (S −1 + P )−1, where P = diag(p1, p2, . . . , pn) ;
• posterior mean h = AP m, where m = [m1, m2, . . . , mn]T .

Looping i from 1 to n until there is no signiﬁcant change in {mi, pi, si}n

• ˜t( f (xi)) is removed from Q( f ) to get a leave-one-out posterior distribution Q\i( f ) having
