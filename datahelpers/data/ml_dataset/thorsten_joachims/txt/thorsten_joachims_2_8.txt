Description

SVMlight is an implementation of Vapnik's Support Vector Machine [Vapnik, 1995] for the
problem of pattern recognition, for the problem of regression, and for the problem of learning a
ranking function. The optimization algorithms used in SVMlight are described in [Joachims, 2002a
]. [Joachims, 1999a]. The algorithm has scalable memory requirements and can handle problems
with many thousands of support vectors efficiently.

The software also provides methods for assessing the generalization performance efficiently. It
includes two efficient estimation methods for both error rate and precision/recall. XiAlpha-
estimates [Joachims, 2002a, Joachims, 2000b] can be computed at essentially no computational
expense, but they are conservatively biased. Almost unbiased estimates provides leave-one-out
testing. SVMlight exploits that the results of most leave-one-outs (often more than 99%) are
predetermined and need not be computed [Joachims, 2002a].

New in this version is an algorithm for learning ranking functions [Joachims, 2002c]. The goal is to
learn a function from preference examples, so that it orders a new set of objects as accurately as
possible. Such ranking problems naturally occur in applications like search engines and
recommender systems.

Futhermore, this version includes an algorithm for training large-scale transductive SVMs. The
algorithm proceeds by solving a sequence of optimization problems lower-bounding the solution
using a form of local search. A detailed description of the algorithm can be found in [Joachims,
1999c]. A similar transductive learner, which can be thought of as a transductive version of
k-Nearest Neighbor is the Spectral Graph Transducer.

SVMlight can also train SVMs with cost models (see [Morik et al., 1999]).

The code has been used on a large range of problems, including text classification [Joachims,
1999c][Joachims, 1998a], image recognition tasks, bioinformatics and medical applications. Many
tasks have the property of sparse instance vectors. This implementation makes use of this property
which leads to a very compact and efficient representation.

I would also appreciate, if you sent me (a link to) your papers so that I can learn about your
research. The implementation was developed on Solaris 2.5 with gcc, but compiles also on SunOS
3.1.4, Solaris 2.7, Linux, IRIX, Windows NT, and Powermac (after small modifications, see
FAQ). The source code is available at the following location:

http://download.joachims.org/svm_light/current/svm_light.tar.gz

If you just want the binaries, you can download them for the following systems:

Solaris: http://download.joachims.org/svm_light/current/svm_light_solaris.tar.gz
Windows: http://download.joachims.org/svm_light/current/svm_light_windows.zip
Cygwin: http://download.joachims.org/svm_light/current/svm_light_cygwin.tar.gz
Linux: http://download.joachims.org/svm_light/current/svm_light_linux.tar.gz

Please send me email and let me know that you got svm-light. I will put you on my mailing list to
inform you about new versions and bug-fixes. SVMlight comes with a quadratic programming tool
for solving small intermediate quadratic programming problems. It is based on the method of
Hildreth and D'Espo and solves small quadratic programs very efficiently. Nevertheless, if for
some reason you want to use another solver, the new version still comes with an interface to
PR_LOQO. The PR_LOQO optimizer was written by A. Smola. It can be requested from
http://www.kernel-machines.org/code/prloqo.tar.gz.

Installation

To install SVMlight you need to download svm_light.tar.gz. Create a new directory:

mkdir svm_light

Move svm_light.tar.gz to this directory and unpack it with

gunzip -c svm_light.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Now execute

make or make all

which compiles the system and creates the two executables

svm_learn (learning module)
svm_classify (classification module)

If you do not want to use the built-in optimizer but PR_LOQO instead, create a subdirectory in the
svm_light directory with

mkdir pr_loqo

and copy the files pr_loqo.c and pr_loqo.h in there. Now execute

make svm_learn_loqo

If the system does not compile properly, check this FAQ.

How to use

This section explains how to use the SVMlight software. A good introduction to the theory of
SVMs is Chris Burges' tutorial.

SVMlight consists of a learning module (svm_learn) and a classification module (svm_classify).
The classification module can be used to apply the learned model to new examples. See also the
examples below for how to use svm_learn and svm_classify.

svm_learn is called with the following parameters:

         -l char     - file to write predicted labels of unlabeled examples 
                       into after transductive learning 
         -a char     - write all alphas to this file after learning (in the 
                       same order as in the training set)

A more detailed description of the parameters and how they link to the respective algorithms is
given in the appendix of [Joachims, 2002a].

The input file example_file contains the training examples. The first lines may contain comments
and are ignored if they start with #. Each of the following lines represents one training example and
is of the following format:

<line> .=. <target> <feature>:<value> <feature>:<value> ... <feature>:<value> #
<info>
<target> .=. +1 | -1 | 0 | <float> 
<feature> .=. <integer> | "qid"
<value> .=. <float>
<info> .=. <string>

The target value and each of the feature/value pairs are separated by a space character.
Feature/value pairs MUST be ordered by increasing feature number. Features with value zero can
be skipped. The string <info> can be used to pass additional information to the kernel (e.g. non
feature vector data). Check the FAQ for more details on how to implement your own kernel.

In classification mode, the target value denotes the class of the example. +1 as the target value
marks a positive example, -1 a negative example respectively. So, for example, the line

-1 1:0.43 3:0.12 9284:0.2 # abcdef

specifies a negative example for which feature number 1 has the value 0.43, feature number 3 has
the value 0.12, feature number 9284 has the value 0.2, and all the other features have value 0. In
addition, the string abcdef is stored with the vector, which can serve as a way of providing
additional information for user defined kernels. A class label of 0 indicates that this example should

be classified using transduction. The predictions for the examples classified by transduction are
written to the file specified through the -l option. The order of the predictions is the same as in the
training data.

In regression mode, the <target> contains the real-valued target value.

In ranking mode [Joachims, 2002c], the target value is used to generated pairwise preference
constraints (see STRIVER). A preference constraint is included for all pairs of examples in the
example_file, for which the target value differs. The special feature "qid" can be used to restrict
the generation of constraints. Two examples are considered for a pairwise preference constraint
only, if the value of "qid" is the same. For example, given the example_file

3 qid:1 1:0.53 2:0.12
2 qid:1 1:0.13 2:0.1
7 qid:2 1:0.87 2:0.12

a preference constraint is included only for the first and the second example(ie. the first should be
ranked higher than the second), but not with the third example, since it has a different "qid".

In all modes, the result of svm_learn is the model which is learned from the training data in
example_file. The model is written to model_file. To make predictions on test examples,
svm_classify reads this file. svm_classify is called with the following parameters:

svm_classify [options] example_file model_file output_file

Available options are:

-h         Help. 
-v [0..3]  Verbosity level (default 2).
-f [0,1]   0: old output format of V1.0
           1: output the value of decision function (default)

The test examples in example_file are given in the same format as the training examples (possibly
with 0 as class label). For all test examples in example_file the predicted values are written to
output_file. There is one line per test example in output_file containing the value of the
decision function on that example. For classification, the sign of this value determines the predicted
class. For regression, it is the predicted value itself, and for ranking the value can be used to order
the test examples. The test example file has the same format as the one for svm_learn. Again,
<class> can have the value zero indicating unknown.

Getting started: some Example Problems

Inductive SVM

You will find an example text classification problem at

http://download.joachims.org/svm_light/examples/example1.tar.gz

Download this file into your svm_light directory and unpack it with

gunzip -c example1.tar.gz | tar xvf -

This will create a subdirectory example1. Documents are represented as feature vectors. Each
feature corresponds to a word stem (9947 features). The task is to learn which Reuters articles are
about "corporate acquisitions". There are 1000 positive and 1000 negative examples in the file
train.dat. The file test.dat contains 600 test examples. The feature numbers correspond to the
line numbers in the file words. To run the example, execute the commands:

svm_learn example1/train.dat example1/model
svm_classify example1/test.dat example1/model example1/predictions

The accuracy on the test set is printed to stdout.

Transductive SVM

To try out the transductive learner, you can use the following dataset (see also Spectral Graph
Transducer). I compiled it from the same Reuters articles as used in the example for the inductive
SVM. The dataset consists of only 10 training examples (5 positive and 5 negative) and the same
600 test examples as above. You find it at

http://download.joachims.org/svm_light/examples/example2.tar.gz

Download this file into your svm_light directory and unpack it with

gunzip -c example2.tar.gz | tar xvf -

This will create a subdirectory example2. To run the example, execute the commands:

svm_learn example2/train_transduction.dat example2/model
svm_classify example2/test.dat example2/model example2/predictions

The classification module is called only to get the accuracy printed. The transductive learner is
invoked automatically, since train_transduction.dat contains unlabeled examples (i. e. the 600
test examples). You can compare the results to those of the inductive SVM by running:

svm_learn example2/train_induction.dat example2/model
svm_classify example2/test.dat example2/model example2/predictions

The file train_induction.dat contains the same 10 (labeled) training examples as
train_transduction.dat.

Ranking SVM

For the ranking SVM [Joachims, 2002c], I created a toy example. It consists of only 12 training
examples in 3 groups and 4 test examples. You find it at

http://download.joachims.org/svm_light/examples/example3.tar.gz

Download this file into your svm_light directory and unpack it with

gunzip -c example3.tar.gz | tar xvf -

This will create a subdirectory example3. To run the example, execute the commands:

svm_learn -z p example3/train.dat example3/model
svm_classify example3/test.dat example3/model example3/predictions

The output in the predictions file can be used to rank the test examples. If you do so, you will see
that it predicts the correct ranking. The values in the predictions file do not have a meaning in an
absolute sense. They are only used for ordering.

It can also be interesting to look at the "training error" of the ranking SVM. The equivalent of
training error for a ranking SVM is the number of training pairs that are misordered by the learned
model. To find those pairs, one can apply the model to the training file:

svm_classify example3/train.dat example3/model example3/predictions.train

Again, the predictions file shows the ordering implied by the model. The model ranks all training
examples correctly.

Note that ranks are comparable only between examples with the same qid. Note also that the target
value (first value in each line of the data files) is only used to define the order of the examples. Its
absolute value does not matter, as long as the ordering relative to the other examples with the same
qid remains the same.
