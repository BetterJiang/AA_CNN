Summary

(cid:15) We derive and implement the ALS algorithm for tting LPCA.

(cid:15) In data reconstruction experiments, LPCA outperforms PCA.

(cid:15) LPCA is well suited for smoothed probability models of binary data:

 People and URLs they click
 Phrase features surrounding image links

(cid:15) Future work will explore LPCA in other traditional PCA tasks.
