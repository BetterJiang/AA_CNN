Abstract

them as mid-level features.

Many successful models for scene or object recognition
transform low-level descriptors (such as Gabor ﬁlter re-
sponses, or SIFT descriptors) into richer representations
of intermediate complexity. This process can often be bro-
ken down into two steps:
(1) a coding step, which per-
forms a pointwise transformation of the descriptors into a
representation better adapted to the task, and (2) a pool-
ing step, which summarizes the coded features over larger
neighborhoods. Several combinations of coding and pool-
ing schemes have been proposed in the literature. The goal
of this paper is threefold. We seek to establish the rela-
tive importance of each step of mid-level feature extrac-
tion through a comprehensive cross evaluation of several
types of coding modules (hard and soft vector quantization,
sparse coding) and pooling schemes (by taking the aver-
age, or the maximum), which obtains state-of-the-art per-
formance or better on several recognition benchmarks. We
show how to improve the best performing coding scheme by
learning a supervised discriminative dictionary for sparse
coding. We provide theoretical and empirical insight into
the remarkable performance of max pooling. By teasing
apart components shared by modern mid-level feature ex-
tractors, our approach aims to facilitate the design of better
recognition architectures.

Popular examples of mid-level features include bags of
features [25], spatial pyramids [12], and the upper units of
convolutional networks [13] or deep belief networks [8, 23].
Extracting these mid-level features involves a sequence
of interchangeable modules similar to that identiﬁed by
Winder and Brown for local image descriptors [29]. In this
paper, we focus on two types of modules:

• Coding: Input features are locally transformed into
representations that have some desirable properties
such as compactness, sparseness (i.e., most compo-
nents are 0), or statistical independence. The code is
typically a vector with binary (vector quantization) or
continuous (HOG, sparse coding) entries, obtained by
decomposing the original feature on some codebook,
or dictionary.

• Spatial pooling: The codes associated with local im-
age features are pooled over some image neighborhood
(e.g., the whole image for bags of features, a coarse
grid of cells for the HOG approach to pedestrian de-
tection, or a coarse hierarchy of cells for spatial pyra-
mids). The codes within each cell are summarized by a
single “semi-local” feature vector, common examples
being the average of the codes (average pooling) or
their maximum (max pooling).

1. Introduction

Finding good image features is critical in modern ap-
proaches to category-level image classiﬁcation. Many
methods ﬁrst extract low-level descriptors (e.g., SIFT [18]
or HOG descriptors [5]) at interest point locations, or nodes
in a dense grid. This paper considers the problem of com-
bining these local features into a global image representa-
tion suited to recognition using a common classiﬁer such as
a support vector machine. Since global features built upon
low-level ones typically remain close to image-level infor-
mation without attempts at high-level, structured image de-
scription (in terms of parts for example), we will refer to

male Sup´erieure, ENS/INRIA/CNRS UMR 8548.

The same coding and pooling modules can be plugged
into various architectures. For example, average pooling
is found in convolutional nets [13], bag-of-features meth-
ods, and HOG descriptors; max pooling is found in convo-
lutional nets [16, 23], HMAX nets [24], and state-of-the-art
variants of the spatial pyramid model [31]. The ﬁnal global
vector is formed by concatenating with suitable weights the
semi-local vectors obtained for each pooling region.

High levels of performance have been reported for spe-
ciﬁc pairings of coding and pooling modules (e.g., sparse
coding and max pooling [31]), but it is not always clear
whether the improvement can be factored into independent
contributions of each module (e.g., whether the better per-
formance of max pooling would generalize to systems us-
ing vector quantization instead of sparse coding). In this

1

work, we address this concern by presenting a comprehen-
sive set of product pairings across known coding (hard and
soft vector quantization, sparse coding) and pooling (aver-
age and max pooling) modules. We have chosen to restrict
ourselves to the spatial pyramid framework since it has al-
ready been used in several comparative studies [27, 31],
deﬁning the state of the art on several benchmarks; but the
insights gained within that framework should easily gen-
eralize to other models (e.g., models using interest point
detectors, convolutional networks, deep belief networks).
Two striking results of our evaluation are that (1) sparse
coding systematically outperforms the other coding mod-
ules, irrespective of the pooling module, and (2) max pool-
ing dramatically improves linear classiﬁcation performance
irrespective of the coding module, to the point that the
worst-performing coding module (hard vector quantization)
paired with max pooling outperforms the best coding mod-
ule (sparse coding) paired with average pooling. The rest of
our paper builds on these two ﬁndings. Noting that the dic-
tionary used to perform sparse coding is trained to minimize
reconstruction error, which might be suboptimal for classi-
ﬁcation, we propose a new supervised dictionary learning
algorithm. As for the superiority of max pooling in lin-
ear classiﬁcation, we complement the empirical ﬁnding by
a theoretical analysis and new experiments. Our article thus
makes three contributions:

• We systematically explore combinations of known
modules appearing in the uniﬁed model presented in
this paper, obtaining state-of-the-art results on two
benchmarks (Sec. 3).

• We introduce a novel supervised sparse dictionary

learning algorithm (Sec. 4).

• We present theoretical and experimental insights into
the much better linear discrimination performance ob-
tained with max pooling compared to average pooling,
in a large variety of settings (Sec. 5).

2. Notation and Related Work

In this section, we introduce some notation used through-
out this paper, and present coding and pooling modules pre-
viously used by other authors. Let an image I be repre-
sented by a set of low-level descriptors (e.g., SIFT) xi at
N locations identiﬁed with their indices i = 1,··· , N .
M regions of interests are deﬁned on the image (e.g., the
21 = 16 + 4 + 1 cells of a three-level spatial pyramid),
with Nm denoting the set of locations/indices within region
m. Let f and g denote some coding and pooling operators,
respectively. The vector z representing the whole image is
obtained by sequentially coding, pooling over all regions,

and concatenating:

αi = f (xi), i = 1,··· , N
hm = g(cid:0){αi}i∈Nm(cid:1) , m = 1,··· , M

zT = [hT

M ].

1 ··· hT

(1)

(2)

(3)

The goal is to determine which operators f and g provide
the best classiﬁcation performance using z as input to either
a non-linear intersection kernel SVM [12], or a linear SVM.
In the usual bag-of-features framework [25], f mini-
mizes the distance to a codebook, usually learned by an un-
supervised algorithm (e.g., K-means), and g computes the
average over the pooling region:

αi ∈ {0, 1}K, αi,j = 1 iff j = argmin

k≤K kxi − dkk2

2,

hm =

1

|Nm| Xi∈Nm

αi,

(4)

(5)

where dk denotes the k-th codeword. Note that averaging
and using uniform weighting is equivalent (up to a constant
multiplicator) to using histograms with weights inversely
proportional to the area of the pooling regions, as in [12].

Van Gemert et al. [27] have obtained improvements by

replacing hard quantization by soft quantization:

αi,j =

exp(cid:0)−βkxi − djk2
2(cid:1)
PK
k=1 exp (−βkxi − dkk2
2)

,

(6)

where β is a parameter that controls the softness of the soft
assignment (hard assignment is the limit when β → ∞).
This amounts to coding as in the E-step of the expectation-
maximization algorithm to learn a Gaussian mixture model,
using codewords of the dictionary as centers.

Sparse coding [22] uses a linear combination of a small
number of codewords to approximate the xi. Yang et
al. [31] have obtained state-of-the-art results by using sparse
coding and max pooling:

αi = argmin

α

hm,j = max
i∈Nm

L(α, D) , kxi − Dαk2
αi,j, for j = 1,··· , K,

2 + λkαk1,

(7)

(8)

where kαk1 denotes the ℓ1 norm of α, λ is a parameter
that controls the sparsity, and D is a dictionary trained by
minimizing the average of L(αi, D) over all samples, al-
ternatively over D and the αi. It is well known that the ℓ1
penalty induces sparsity and makes the problem tractable
(e.g., [15, 19]).

Caltech-101 [6] and Scenes datasets [12] as benchmarks.
These datasets respectively comprise 101 object categories
(plus a ”background” category) and ﬁfteen scene categories.
Following the usual procedure [12, 31], we use 30 train-
ing images and the rest for testing (with a maximum of 50
test images) on the Caltech-101 dataset, and 100 training
images and the rest for testing on the Scenes dataset. Ex-
periments are conducted over 10 random splits of the data,
and we report the mean accuracy and its standard devia-
tion. Hyperparameters of the model are selected by cross-
validation within the training set. The general architecture
follows [12]. Low-level descriptors xi are 128-dimensional
SIFT descriptors [18] of 16 × 16 patches. The descriptors
are extracted on a dense grid rather than at interest points,
as this procedure has been shown to yield superior scene
classiﬁcation [17]. Pooling regions m comprise the cells of
4× 4, 2× 2 and 1× 1 grids (forming a three-level pyramid).
We use the SPAMS toolbox [1] to compute sparse codes.

3.1. Interaction Between Modules

Here, we perform a systematic cross evaluation of all the
coding, pooling and classiﬁer types presented in Sec. 2, with
SIFT descriptors extracted densely every 8 pixels. Results
are presented on Table 1. The ranking of performance when
changing a particular module (e.g., coding) is quite consis-
tent:

• Sparse coding improves over soft quantization, which

improves over hard quantization;

• Max pooling almost always improves over average

pooling, dramatically so when using a linear SVM;

• The intersection kernel SVM performs similarly or

better than the linear SVM.

In particular, the global feature obtained when using hard
vector quantization with max pooling achieves high accu-

racy with a linear classiﬁer, while being binary, and merely
recording the presence or absence of each codeword in the
pools. While much research has been devoted to devising
the best possible coding module, our results show that with
linear classiﬁcation, switching from average to max pooling
increases accuracy more than switching from hard quanti-
zation to sparse coding. These results could serve as guide-
lines for the design of future architectures.

For comparison, previously published results obtained
using one type of descriptors on the same dataset are shown
on Table 2. Note that better performance has been re-
ported with multiple descriptor types (e.g., methods using
multiple kernel learning have achieved 77.7% ± 0.3 [7]
and 78.0% ± 0.3 [2, 28] on Caltech-101 with 30 train-
ing examples), or subcategory learning (83% on Caltech-
101 [26]). The coding and pooling module combinations
used in [27, 31] are included in our comparative evaluation
(bold numbers in parentheses on Tables 1 and 2). Over-
all, our results conﬁrm the experimental ﬁndings in these
works, except that we do not ﬁnd superior performance for
the linear SVM, compared to the intersection kernel SVM,
with sparse codes and max pooling, contrary to Yang et
al. [31]. Results of our reimplementation are similar to
those in [12]. The better performance than that reported by
Van Gemert et al. [27] or Yang et al. [31] on the Scenes is
not surprising since their baseline accuracy for the method
in [12] is also lower, which they attributed to implementa-
tion differences. Discrepancies with results from Yang et
al. [31] may arise from their using a differentiable quadratic
hinge loss instead of the standard hinge loss in the SVM,
and a different type of normalization for SIFT descriptors.

3.2. Macrofeatures and denser SIFT sampling

In convolutional neural networks (e.g., [16, 23]), spa-
tial neighborhoods of low-level features are encoded jointly.
On the other hand, codewords in bag-of-features methods
usually encode low-level features at a single location (see
Fig. 1). We propose to adapt the joint encoding scheme to
the spatial pyramid framework.

Jointly encoding L descriptors in a local spatial neigh-

borhood Li amounts to replacing Eq. (1) by:

Figure 1. Standard features encode the SIFT features at a single
spatial point. Macrofeatures jointly encode small spatial neigh-
borhoods of SIFT features (i.e., the input of the coding module is
formed by concatenating nearby SIFT descriptors).

We have experimented with different macrofeature pa-
rameters, and denser sampling of the underlying SIFT de-
scriptor map (e.g., extracting SIFT every 4 pixels instead of
8 pixels as in the baseline of [12]). We have tested sampling
densities of 2 to 10, and macrofeatures of side length 2 to 4
and subsampling parameter 1 to 4. When using sparse cod-
ing and max pooling, the best parameters (selected by cross-
validation within the training set) for SIFT sampling den-
sity, macrofeature side length and subsampling parameter
are respectively of 4, 2, 4 for the Caltech-101 dataset, and
8, 2, 1 for the Scenes dataset. Our results (Table 1, bottom)
show that large improvements can be gained on the Caltech-
101 benchmark, by merely sampling SIFT descriptors more
ﬁnely, and jointly representing nearby descriptors, yielding
a classiﬁcation accuracy of 75.7%, which to the best of our
knowledge is signiﬁcantly better than all published classiﬁ-
cation schemes using a single type of low-level descriptor.
However, we have not found ﬁner sampling and joint encod-
ing to help recognition signiﬁcantly on the Scenes dataset.

i1 ··· xT

4. Discriminative dictionaries

In the following, we call macrofeatures vectors that
jointly encode a small neighborhood of SIFT descriptors.
The encoded neighborhoods are squares determined by two
the side of the square (e.g., 2 × 2 square
parameters:
on Fig. 1), and a subsampling parameter determining how
many SIFT descriptors to skip along each dimension when
selecting neighboring features. For example, a 3× 3 macro-
feature with a subsampling parameter of 2 jointly encodes 9
descriptors out of a 6 × 6 grid, skipping every other column
and row.

The feature extraction schemes presented so far are all
unsupervised. When using sparse coding, an adaptive dic-
tionary is learned by minimizing a regularized reconstruc-
tion error. While this ensures that the parameters of the dic-
tionary are adapted to the statistics of the data, the dictio-
nary is not optimized for the classiﬁcation task. In this sec-
tion, we introduce a novel supervised method to learn the
dictionary.

Several authors have proposed methods to obtain dis-
criminative codebooks. Lazebnik and Raginsky [11] incor-

porate discriminative information by minimizing the loss of
mutual information between features and labels during the
quantization step. Winn et al. [30] prune a large codebook
iteratively by fusing codewords that do not contribute to dis-
crimination. However these methods are optimized for vec-
tor quantization. Mairal et al. [20] have proposed an algo-
rithm to train discriminative dictionaries for sparse coding,
but it requires each encoded vector to be labelled. Instead,
the approach we propose is adapted to global image statis-
tics.

With the same notation as before, let us consider the ex-
traction of a global image representation by sparse coding
and average pooling over the whole image I:

Consider a binary classiﬁcation problem. Let z(n) de-
note the global image representation for the n-th training
image, and yn ∈ {−1, 1} the image label. A linear classi-
ﬁer is trained by minimizing with respect to parameter θ the

similar to that of linear SVMs but unlike SVMs, its loss
function is differentiable. We want to minimize the super-
vised cost Cs with respect to D to obtain a more discrimi-
native dictionary. Using the chain rule, we obtain:

where we have dropped subscript i to limit notation clutter,
and Dα denotes the columns corresponding to the active
set of α (i.e., the few columns of D used in the decomposi-
tion of the input). Note that this formula cannot be used to

compute α, as parts of the right-hand side of the equation
depend on α itself, but it can be used to compute a gradient
once α is known. When perturbations of the dictionary are
small, the active set of α often stays the same (since the cor-
relation between the atoms of the dictionary and the input
vector varies continuously with the dictionary). Assuming
that it is constant, we can compute the gradient of the active
coefﬁcients with respect to the active columns of D (setting
it to 0 elsewhere):

We train the discriminative dictionary by stochastic gra-
dient descent [4, 14]. Recomputing the sparse decompo-
sitions αi at each location of a training image at each it-
eration is costly. To speed-up the computation while re-
maining closer to global image statistics than with individ-
ual patches, we approximate z(n) by pooling over a random
sample of ten locations of the image. Furthermore, we up-
date only a random subset of coordinates at each iteration,
since computation of the gradient is costly. We then test the
dictionary with max pooling and a three-layer spatial pyra-
mid, using either a linear or intersection kernel SVM.

We compare performance of dictionaries of sizes 1024
and 2048 on the Scenes dataset, encoding 2×2 neighbor-
hoods of SIFT. Results (Table 3) show that discriminative
dictionaries perform signiﬁcantly better than unsupervised
dictionaries. A discriminative dictionary of 2048 code-
words achieves 85.6% correct recognition performance,
which to the best of our knowledge is the highest pub-
lished classiﬁcation accuracy on that dataset for a single fea-
ture type. Discriminative training of dictionaries with our
method on the Caltech-101 dataset has yielded only very
little improvement, probably due to the scarcity of training
data.

5. Comparing Average and Max Pooling

One of the most striking results of our comparative
evaluation is that the superiority of max pooling over av-

erage pooling generalizes to many combinations of cod-
ing schemes and classiﬁers. Several authors have already
stressed the efﬁciency of max pooling [10, 31], but they
have not given theoretical explanations to their ﬁndings. In
this section, we study max pooling in more details theoreti-
cally and experimentally.

5.1. A Theoretical Comparison of Pooling Strategies

With the same notation as before, consider a binary lin-
ear classiﬁcation task over cluttered images. Pooling is per-
formed over the whole image, so that the pooled feature
h is the global image representation. Linear classiﬁcation
requires distributions of h over examples from positive and
negative classes (henceforth denoted by + and −) to be well
separated.
We model the distribution of image patches of a given
class as a mixture of two distributions [21]: patches are
taken from the actual class distribution (foreground) with
probability (1 − w), and from a clutter distribution (back-
ground) with probability w, with clutter patches being
present in both classes (+ or −). Crucially, we model the
amount of clutter w as varying between images (while being
ﬁxed for a given image).

There are then two sources of variance for the distribu-
tion p(h): the intrinsic variance caused by sampling from a
ﬁnite pool for each image (which causes the actual value of
h over foreground patches to deviate from its expectation),
and the variance of w (which causes the expectation of h
itself to ﬂuctuate from image to image depending on their
If the pool cardinality N is large, average
clutter level).
pooling is robust to intrinsic foreground variability, since
the variance of the average decreases in 1
N . This is usually
not the case with max pooling, where the variance can in-
crease with pool cardinality depending on the foreground
distribution.

However, if the amount of clutter w has a high variance,
it causes the distribution of the average over the image to
spread, as the expectation of h for each image depends on
w. Even if the foreground distributions are well separated,
variance in the amount of clutter creates overlap between
the mixture distributions if the mean of the background dis-
tribution is much lower than that of the foreground distri-
butions. Conversely, max pooling can be robust to clutter
if the mean of the background distribution is sufﬁciently
low. This is illustrated on Fig. 2, where we have plotted the
empirical distributions of the average of 10 pooled features
sharing the same parameters. Simulations are run using
1000 images of each class, composed of N = 500 patches.
For each image, the clutter level w is drawn from a truncated
normal distribution with either low (top) or high (bottom)
variance. Local feature values at each patch are drawn from
a mixture of exponential distributions, with a lower mean

class. When the clutter has high variance (Fig. 2, bottom),
distributions remain well separated with max pooling, but
have signiﬁcant overlap with average pooling.

We now reﬁne our analysis in two cases: sparse codes

and vector quantized codes.

5.1.1 Sparse Codes.

In the case of a positive decomposition over a dictionary,
we model the distribution of the value of feature j for each
patch by an exponential distribution with mean µj, variance
j , and density f (x) = 1
µ2
µj . The choice of an expo-
µ j
nential distribution (or a Laplace distribution when decom-
positions are not constrained to be positive) to model sparse
codes seems appropriate because it is highly kurtotic and
sparse codes have heavy tails.

exp− x

F (x) = 1 − e− x
the max-pooled feature is F N (x) = (1−e− x

The corresponding cumulative distribution function is
µj . The cumulative distribution function of
µj )N for a pool
of size N . Clutter patches are sampled from a distribution
of mean µb. Let Nf and Nb denote respectively the num-
ber of foreground and background patches, N = Nf + Nb.
Assuming Nf and Nb are large, Taylor expansions of the
cumulative distribution functions of the maxima yield that
95% of the probability mass of the maximum over the back-
ground patches will be below 95% of the probability mass
of the maximum over the foreground patches provided that

µj

µb . In a binary discrimi-
nation task between two comparatively similar classes, if
an image is cluttered by many background patches, with

| log(0.05)|(cid:17)

Nb < | log(0.95)|(cid:16)
µb ≪ µ+

j and µb ≪ µ−j , max-pooling can be relatively

immune to background patches, while average-pooling can
create overlap between the distributions (see Fig. 2). For
example, if µb < 2µj and Nf = 500, having fewer than
Nb < 1400 background patches virtually guarantees that
the clutter will have no inﬂuence on the value of the maxi-
mum. Conversely, if Nb < Nf
Nf , clutter will
have little inﬂuence for µb up to µj. Thus, max-pooling
creates immunity to two different types of clutter: ubiqui-
tous with low feature activation, and infrequent with higher
activation.

59 ≤ | log(0.95)|
| log(0.05)|

However, a downside is that the ratio of the mean to the
standard deviation of the maximum distribution does not
, as in the case of the distribution of the
decrease as
average. In fact, the mean and variance of the maximum
distribution over N samples can be shown to be:

1√N

σ2 =  N

so that the ratio ν

σ decreases like

1√log(N )

. Thus, if the

pool cardinality is too small, the distributions of foreground
patches from both classes will be better separated with av-
erage pooling than max pooling.

5.1.2 Vector Quantization.

We model binary patch codes for feature j by i.i.d.
Bernoulli random variables of mean µj. The distribu-
tion of the average-pooled feature also has mean µj,
and its variance decreases like 1
N . The maximum is a
Bernoulli variable of mean 1 − (1 − µj)N and variance
(1 − (1 − µj)N )(1 − µj)N . Thus, it is 1 with probability
0.95 if N ≥ log(0.05)
, and 0 with probability
0.95 if N ≤ log(0.95)
, for µj ≪ 1. The sep-
arability of classes depends on sample cardinality N. There
exists a sample cardinality N for which the maximum over
class + is 0 with probability 0.95, while the maximum over
class − is 1 with probability 0.95, if:

log(1−µj ) ≈ | log(0.05)|
log(1−µj ) ≈ | log(0.95)|

AsPj µj = 1 in the context of vector quantization, µj be-
comes very small on average if the codebook is very large.
For µj ≪ 1, the characteristic scale of the transition from 0
to 1 is 1
, hence the pooling cardinality range correspond-
µj
ing to easily separable distributions can be quite large if
the mean over foreground patches from one class is much
higher than both the mean over foreground patches from
the other class and the mean over background patches.

5.2. Experimental Validation

Our analysis suggests that there may be a purely statis-
tical component to the improvement seen with max pool-
ing when using pyramids instead of plain bags of features.
Taking the maximum over several pools of smaller cardinal-
ity may lead to a richer estimate, since max pooling differs
from average pooling in two important ways:

• the maximum over a pool of smaller cardinality is not
merely an estimator of the maximum over a larger
pool;

• the variance of the maximum is not inversely propor-
tional to pool cardinality, so that summing over sev-
eral estimates (one for each smaller pool) can provide
a smoother output than if pooling had merely been per-
formed over the merged smaller pools.

We have tested this hypothesis by comparing three types of
pooling procedures: standard whole-image and two-level
pyramid pooling, and random two-level pyramid pooling,
where local features are randomly permuted before being
pooled, effectively removing all spatial information.

For this experiment, SIFT features are extracted densely
every 8 pixels, and encoded by hard quantization over a
codebook of size 256 for Caltech-101, 1024 for the Scenes.
The pooled features are concatenated and classiﬁed with a
linear SVM, trained on 30 and 100 examples for Caltech-
101 and the Scenes, respectively.

Table 4. Classiﬁcation accuracy for different sets of pools and
pooling operators.

Results (Table 4) show that with max pooling, a substan-
tial part of the increase in accuracy seen when using a two-
level pyramid instead of a plain bag of features is indeed
still present when locations are randomly shufﬂed. On the
contrary, the performance of average pooling tends to dete-
riorate with the pyramid, since the added smaller, random
pools only contribute noisier, redundant information.

6. Discussion

By deconstructing the mid-level coding step of a well-
accepted recognition architecture, it appears that any pa-
rameter in the architecture can contribute to recognition per-
formance; in particular, surprisingly large performance in-
creases can be obtained by merely sampling the low-level
descriptor map more ﬁnely, and representing neighboring
descriptors jointly. We have presented a scheme to train su-
pervised discriminative dictionaries for sparse coding; our
ongoing research focuses on extending this framework to
the much harder PASCAL datasets, on which methods very
similar to the ones discussed in this paper [31] currently
deﬁne the state of the art. We plan to combine our discrimi-
native sparse training algorithm with the various techniques
(e.g., local coordinate coding) that have been successful on
PASCAL. Another research direction we are pursuing is the
analysis of pooling schemes. Understanding pooling opera-
tors is crucial to good model design, since common heuris-
tics suited to average pooling may be suboptimal in other
contexts. In this paper, we have only brieﬂy touched upon
the statistical properties of max pooling. We are currently
investigating how to expand these theoretical insights, and
turn them into guidelines for better architecture design.
