F(x) is a peaked but nonsingular function of x, be-
cause for x 5 0, the right-hand side is finite. The
constant w1 is determined by the condition of nor-

function of w1, is unbounded from above when V

how small Q is, w1 can be chosen so that F(x) in Eq.

ward, and the convergence of analogous integrals is
the key to the presence of delta functions in F(x).

Sensorimotor Adaptation in Speech Production

John F. Houde*† and Michael I. Jordan

Human subjects are known to adapt their motor behavior to a shift of the visual field
brought about by wearing prism glasses over their eyes. The analog of this phenomenon
was studied in the speech domain. By use of a device that can feed back transformed
speech signals in real time, subjects were exposed to phonetically sensible, online
perturbations of their own speech patterns. It was found that speakers learn to adjust
their production of a vowel to compensate for feedback alterations that change the
vowel’s perceived phonetic identity; moreover, the effect generalizes across phonetic
contexts and to different vowels.

where A ($0) is determined by normalization (Eq. 6).
When V 5 1 and V 5 2, the x integral that results
from the normalization condition, *f1(x 2 y)/[1 2
w1(x)]dVx, diverges and hence definitely rules out
these V values. For V $ 3, the same integral is finite,
and when a ,, 1, the delta function term must be
present (that is, A (cid:222) 0) in order that F(x) is normal-
ized to unity. Thus, F(x) contains a singular delta
function part for V $ 3 when a ,, 1.

If, for a given value of V, the mutation rate Q (and
hence a) is large enough that the condition of nor-
malization yields A , 0, then we can infer that the
5 1 2 Q does not apply to this value of V.

For example, if Vs/m2 5 100, then, when 1.67 . a .

does apply for V $ 4.

Distributions: We determine approximate forms
for the distribution of a single character, say x1, and
we denote the single character distribution by F
1(x1).
We use the house-of-cards approximation (13, 31),
which entails replacing *f 1(x 2 y)w1(y)F(y)dVy in

When human subjects are asked to reach
to a visual target while wearing displacing
prisms over their eyes, they are observed to
miss the target initially, but to adapt rapidly
such that within a few movements their
reaching appears once again to be rapid and
natural. Moreover, when the displacing

prisms are subsequently removed subjects
are observed to show an aftereffect; in par-
ticular, they miss the target in the direction
opposite to the displacement. This basic
result has provided an important tool for
investigating the nature of the sensorimotor
control system and its adaptive response to
perturbations (1).

The experiment described in this report is
based on an analogy between reaching
movements in limb control and articulatory
movements in speech production. Although
reaching and speaking are qualitatively very
different motor acts, they nonetheless share
the similarity of having sensory goals—

reaching movements are made to touch or
grasp a target, and articulatory movements
are made to produce a desired acoustic pat-
tern. It is therefore reasonable to ask wheth-
er the speech motor control system might
also respond adaptively to alterations of sen-
sory feedback (2). However, beyond the in-
trinsic interest of speech motor control and
the importance of discovering commonali-
ties between different effector systems, there
are also advantages to studying sensorimotor
adaptation in the speech domain. Whereas
in arm movement research there is little
agreement as to the nature of the underlying
discrete units of complex movements (and
indeed there is controversy as to whether or
not such discrete units exist), in speech there
is substantial evidence regarding an underly-
ing discrete control system. In particular, the
disciplines of phonology and phonetics have
provided linguistic and psychological evi-
dence for the existence of discrete units such
as syllables (3), phonemes (4), and features
(5). There are still major controversies, how-
ever, regarding the role of such discrete units
in the online control of speech production
(6). An important reason for the lack of
agreement is methodological; in particular,
there is no agreed-upon methodology for
decomposing
acoustic
records into segments that might be identi-
fied with underlying control
structures.
Thus, while linguistic and psychological ev-
idence have provided useful hypotheses as to
the putative discrete control structures un-
derlying speech motor control, it has proven
difficult to evaluate these hypotheses direct-
ly in experiments on speech motor control.
Our research provides a new line of at-
tack on this problem. In an adaptation par-
adigm, we can expose subjects to acoustic
perturbations of their articulatory output in

articulatory

and

one linguistic context and ask whether any
adaptation that is found transfers to another
linguistic context. For example, if the for-
mants of the vowel [e ] are altered in the
context of “pep,” we can ask whether adap-
tation generalizes to [e ] in the context of
“set” or in the context of “forget.” We can
also ask whether adaptation is observed for
other vowels. Such manipulations provide a
direct probe of the putative hierarchical,
segmental control of speech production.

We built an apparatus to alter subjects’
feedback in real time (Fig. 1). The appara-
tus allows us to shift formant frequencies
independently so as to impose arbitrary per-
turbations on the speech signal within the
two-dimensional (F1, F2) formant space (7–
9). This apparatus was used in an experi-
ment in which a subject whispered 4220
prompted words over approximately 2
hours. The experiment consisted of the fol-
lowing: a 10-min acclimation phase; a 17-
min baseline phase; a 20-min ramp phase; a
1-hour training phase; and a 17-min test
phase. During the ramp phase, the feedback

tered,

During the experiment, the subject was
prompted to produce words randomly select-
ed from two different sets: a set of training
words (in which adaptation was induced)
and a set of testing words (in which car-
ryover of the training word adaptation was
measured). Test and training words were in-
terspersed with one another throughout the
experiment. However, only when the subject
produced training words was he exposed to
the altered feedback. The training words
were all bilabial consonant-vowel-conso-
nants (CVC) with [e ] as the vowel (“pep,”

“peb,” “bep,” and “beb”) and the subject
produced them while hearing either feed-
back of his whispering or masking noise that
blocked his auditory feedback (11). The set
of testing words was divided into two subsets,
each designed to assess different types of
carryover of the training word adaptation.
Three of the testing words—“peg,” “gep,”
and “teg”—were included to determine if the
adaptation of [e ] in the bilabial training word
context carried over to [e ] in different word
contexts. The remaining testing words—
“pip,” “peep,” “pap,” and “pop”—were in-
cluded to determine if the adaptation of [e ]
caused similar production changes in other
vowels.

Eight male Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) students participated in
the study. All were native speakers of North
American English and all were naı¨ve to the
purpose of the study (12). Each was run in
the adaptation experiment and also in a
control experiment that was identical to
the adaptation experiment except that no
feedback perturbations were introduced.

Figure 2 shows the feedback transforma-
tions and resulting compensation and adap-
tation for a single subject. The diamonds
show mean formant positions of the subject’s
productions of the vowels [i], [i], [e ], [æ], and
[A], as measured in a pretest procedure sev-
eral days before the actual adaptation exper-
iment. Formants were shifted along the path
linking the positions of these vowels (dotted
line) (13). Formants were shifted in one
direction along this path for half the sub-
jects; they were shifted in the opposite direc-
tion for the other subjects. The formant
shifts were large enough that if the subject
produced [e ], he heard either [i] or [A], de-
pending on the direction of shift.

For the subject in Fig. 2, formants were
shifted toward [i]. Formants were shifted in
proportion to the spacing between vowels on

the speech
signal was picked up by a
microphone and sent to a digital signal processing (DSP) board in the PC. The DSP board processed
successive intervals of the subject’s speech into synthesized, formant-altered feedback with only a 16-ms
processing delay [such a delay is nondisruptive; see reference to DAF in (2)]. Each interval was first analyzed
into a 64-channel, 4 kHz–wide magnitude spectrum from which formants (which are generally peaks in the
spectrum) were estimated (all graphs are schematic plots of magnitude versus frequency). The frequencies of
the three lowest frequency formants (F1, F2, and F3) were then shifted to implement a desired feedback
alteration (as explained below). The shifted formants were then used to synthesize formant-altered whispered
speech. This synthesized speech was fed back to the subject via earphones at sufficient volume that he
essentially heard only the synthesized feedback of his whispering.

tion and adaptation for a single subject (subject

the path: If the subject produced [e ] his
formants were shifted so he heard [i]; if he
produced [æ] he heard [i]; and if he pro-
duced [A] he heard [e ]. Position B (Fig. 2)
corresponds to the mean vowel formants
for the training words produced by the
subject in the baseline phase of the adap-
tation experiment. B9 shows the formants
presented to the subject as a result of the
altered feedback.

The arrow labeled “compensation” is the
subject’s compensation to the altered feed-
back: The arrow shows that, in response to
hearing B as B9, the subject has, by the test
phase of the experiment, changed his pro-
duction of B to T. The arrow labeled “al-
tered feedback” shows that the altered feed-
back causes the subject to hear the produc-
tion change as a shift from B9 to T9. The
arrow shows that, by the experiment’s test
phase, the subject now hears his formants at
T9, which are close to the baseline, B. The
subject has thus compensated for the al-
tered feedback. The arrow labeled “adapta-
tion” shows how much of the compensation
is retained when the feedback is blocked by
noise (in this case, about 72% is retained).
The analysis of mean compensation and
mean adaptation across subjects is shown in
Fig. 3 (14). The figure shows that the ma-
jority of subjects significantly compensated
(P , 0.006) and adapted (P , 0.023) (15).
The figure also shows other features com-
monly seen in adaptation experiments in the
reaching domain: compensation varies across
subjects, each subject compensates more
than he adapts, and subjects that tend to
compensate more also tend to adapt more.
Figure 4 shows mean generalization for

the test words—a ratio expressing the frac-
tion of the adaptation of [e ] in the training
words that carried over to the vowel pro-
duction in a testing word (16). Adaptation
to the training set affected the production
of the vowels in test words containing the
same vowel but in different consonant con-
texts (Fig. 4A). Overall, there is significant
generalization of the training word adapta-
tion to these test words (P , 0.040) (17).
However, the apparently greater mean gen-
eralization to “peg” than to “gep” and “teg”
is not statistically significant. This lack of
significance is traceable to coarticulatory
influences that caused imperfect estimates
of steady-state vowel
in
“gep” and “teg”.

formants of

[e ]

Adaptation to the training set affected
the production of the vowels in words
containing different vowels (Fig. 4B) (18).
Again, there is overall significant general-
ization of the training word adaptation to
these test words (P , 0.013), but again,
the apparent differences in mean general-
ization between the words is not statisti-
cally significant.

In summary, our experimental

results
show that control of the production of vow-
els adapts to perturbations of auditory feed-
back. This adaptation is analogous to the
adaptation seen in the control of reaching.
Moreover, the generalization observed for [e ]
in the testing words provides direct evidence
that the testing and the training words share
a common representation of the production
of [e ]; it is of course natural to hypothesize
that this common representation is the pho-
neme [e ]. Finally, the significant generaliza-
tion to “pip” and “pap” considered together

REPORTS
shows that the adaptation of a vowel can
spread not only across contexts but also to
other vowels. This suggests that the control
process underlying the production of the
trained vowel is partially shared in the con-
trol of the productions of other vowels;
moreover, it is natural to attempt to identify
these control structures with the featural de-
compositions studied in phonology.

2. The studies reported in W. E. Cooper [Speech Per-
ception and Production (Ablex Publishing, Norwood,
NJ, 1979)] showed the interdependence of speech
perception and production:
repetitive hearing of
voiceless consonants decreases the perceived
voice-onset time ( VOT ) of test stimuli and also de-
creases the VOT of produced consonants. Masking
noise feedback increases speech volume [E. Lom-
bard, Ann. Maladies Oreille Larynx Nez Pharynx 37,
101 (1911), as cited in H. Lane and B. Tranel, J.
Speech Hear. Res. 14, 677 (1971)]. Investigations of
delayed auditory feedback (DAF) show that delays of
30 ms can disrupt speech [B. S. Lee, J. Acoust. Soc.
Am. 22, 639 (1950); see A. J. Yates, Psychol. Bull.
60, 213 (1963) for a review]. Frequency translations
of the spectrum of the auditory feedback have also
been shown to affect speech [ V. L. Gracco et al., J.
Acoust. Soc. Am. 95, 2821 (1994)]. Recent investi-
gations of pitch perturbations have shown adaptive
responses by speakers to alterations in their pitch
frequency [H. Kawahara, ibid. 94, 1883 (1993)].

sounds in the three dimensions F1, F2, and F3. How-
ever, because F3 shows small variation across the
vowel sounds we studied, our perturbations acted
principally on only F1 and F2.

8. Given that subjects show substantial variation in the
location of their vowels within this space, we collect-
ed baseline data for each subject that allowed us to
tailor the transformations to individual subjects.

experiment type (adaptation versus control) and path
projection changes was used to judge significance.
16. For a given test word, mean generalization was com-
puted as: (mean test word relative adaptation)/(mean
training word relative adaptation), where relative ad-
aptation was computed by subtracting adaptation
seen in the control experiment from that seen in the
adaptation experiment.

17. Tests of significant generalization were based on
computing the significance of test word adaptations,
which were computed the same way as the training
word adaptation significance tests described in (15).

of whispered [i] and [A]; thus, productions of “peep”
and “pop” were excluded from our results.

To analyze the composition of

the
APC, we labeled cells expressing Cdc16p
with Myc epitopes (Cdc16-Myc6p) with
35S, and the complex was immunoprecipi-
tated with an antibody to Myc (11). Pro-
teins of ;90 (Apc2p) and 70 kD were
detected in addition to Apc1p, Cdc16-
Myc6p, Cdc27p, and Cdc23p (Fig. 1A).
Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that
the 70-kD band consists of two proteins,
p70 (Apc5p) and p68 (Apc4p). Proteins
migrating at ;40 (Apc9p), 32 (Apc10p),
23 (Apc11p), 20 [Cdc26p (8)], and 19 kD
(Apc13p) were also detected (Fig. 1B).
All of these proteins were detected in
precipitates from strains expressing differ-
ent epitope-tagged APC subunits but not
from control strains, indicating that the
yeast complex contains at least 12 differ-
ent subunits.

To identify these proteins, we purified
the APC from CDC16-myc6 or CDC23-

back was altered during the experiment.

11. A sound-pressure level of 60 dB was sufficient to
block subjects’ ability to hear their own whispering.
12. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects
after the nature and possible consequences of the
study were explained.

13. Feedback transformations were defined geometri-
cally with respect to a subject’s [i]-[A] path. The sub-
ject’s unaltered formant frequencies were represent-
ed as a point in formant space. This point was then
rerepresented in terms of two measures: (i) path de-
viation—the distance to the nearest point on the
[i]-[A] path, and (ii) path projection—the position on
the [i]-[A] path of this nearest point. The feedback
transformation then shifted only the point’s path pro-
jection; the point’s path deviation was preserved.

14. Mean compensation measures how much a subject’s
mean training word vowel formant change (test phase –
baseline) countered the shift of the feedback transfor-

mation. It was measured as: (path projection of mean
vowel formant change)/(–path projection shift of trans-
form) [see (13) for explanation of path projection]. This
ratio is 1.0 for perfect compensation. Mean adaptation
measured how much compensation was retained in the
absence of feedback. Thus, mean adaptation was cal-
culated with the same ratio shown above, except it used
only formant data collected when the subject whispered
with feedback blocked by noise. (In the control experi-
ment, because feedback was not altered, mean com-
pensation and adaptation for each subject were calcu-
lated with respect to the feedback alteration used in the
adaptation experiment.)

15. Analysis-of-variance tests of path projection chang-
es (test phase – baseline) across subjects in the
adaptation and control experiments were computed
from formant data collected when subjects whis-
pered while hearing feedback (for the compensation
analysis) or while hearing was blocked by masking

Entry into anaphase and exit from mitosis depend on a ubiquitin–protein ligase complex
called the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) or cyclosome. At least 12 different sub-
units were detected in the purified particle from budding yeast, including the previously
identified proteins Apc1p, Cdc16p, Cdc23p, Cdc26p, and Cdc27p. Five additional sub-
units purified in low nanogram amounts were identified by tandem mass spectrometric
sequencing. Apc2p, Apc5p, and the RING-finger protein Apc11p are conserved from
yeast to humans. Apc2p is similar to the cullin Cdc53p, which is a subunit of the
ubiquitin–protein ligase complex SCFCdc4 required for the initiation of DNA replication.

yeast genome provide a strategy to identify
the components of multiprotein complexes
that can be biochemically purified (10). We
used this approach to identify five addition-
al subunits of the APC.

The APC mediates cell cycle–regulated
ubiquitination, and thereby degradation, of
proteins containing sequences called de-
struction boxes (1–4). Entry into anaphase
depends on the degradation of proteins such
as Pds1p and Cut2p, which inhibit sister
chromatid separation (5, 6). Degradation of
mitotic cyclins inactivates cyclin-dependent
kinases (CDKs), which is important for exit
from mitosis and is a prerequisite for DNA-
replication in the subsequent cell cycle (7).
Five subunits of the yeast APC (Apc1p,
Cdc16p, Cdc23p, Cdc26p, and Cdc27p)
have been identified through genetic anal-
ysis (3, 8). However, additional subunits
were detected in APC particles purified
from yeast and Xenopus oocytes (8, 9). Ad-
vances in the analysis of proteins by mass
spectrometry and sequencing of the entire
