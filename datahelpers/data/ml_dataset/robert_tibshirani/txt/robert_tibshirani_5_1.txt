The proposal of Reshef et al. (2011) is an interesting new approach
for discovering non-linear dependencies among pairs of measurements
in exploratory data mining. However, it has a potentially serious draw-
back. The authors laud the fact that MIC has no preference for some
alternatives over others, but as the authors know, there is no free lunch
in Statistics: tests which strive to have high power against all alterna-
tives can have low power in many important situations. To investigate
this, we ran simulations to compare the power of MIC to that of stan-
dard Pearson correlation and distance correlation (dcor). We simulated
pairs of variables with diﬀerent relationships (most of which were con-
sidered by the Reshef et. al.), but with varying levels of noise added.
To determine proper cutoﬀs for testing the independence hypothesis,
we simulated independent data with the appropriate marginals. As
one can see from the Figure, MIC has lower power than dcor, in every
case except the somewhat pathological high-frequency sine wave. MIC
is sometimes less powerful than Pearson correlation as well, the linear
case being particularly worrisome.

This set of dependencies is by no means exhaustive, however it sug-
gests that MIC has serious power deﬁciencies, and hence when it is
used for large-scale exploratory analysis it will produce too many false
positives. The “equitability” property of MIC is not very useful, if it
has low power.

We believe that the recently proposed distance correlation measure
of Székely & Rizzo (2009) is a more powerful technique that is simple,
easy to compute and should be considered for general use. A full R
language script for our analysis appears in:
