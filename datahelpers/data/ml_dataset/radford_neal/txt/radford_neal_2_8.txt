Abstract. I consider the puzzles arising from four interrelated problems involving “anthropic”
reasoning, and in particular the “Self-Sampling Assumption” (SSA) — that one should reason
as if one were randomly chosen from the set of all observers in a suitable reference class. The
problem of Freak Observers might appear to force acceptance of SSA if any empirical evidence
is to be credited. The Sleeping Beauty problem arguably shows that one should also accept
the “Self-Indication Assumption” (SIA) — that one should take one’s own existence as evidence
that the number of observers is more likely to be large than small. But this assumption produces
apparently absurd results in the Presumptuous Philosopher problem. Without SIA, however,
a deﬁnitive refutation of the counterintuitive Doomsday Argument seems diﬃcult. I show that
these problems are satisfyingly resolved by applying the principle that one should always con-
dition on all evidence — not just on the fact that you are an intelligent observer, or that you
are human, but on the fact that you are a human with a speciﬁc set of memories. This “Full
Non-indexical Conditioning” (FNC) approach usually produces the same results as assuming
both SSA and SIA, with a suﬃciently broad reference class, while avoiding their ad hoc aspects.
I argue that the results of FNC are correct using the device of hypothetical “companion” ob-
servers, whose existence clariﬁes what principles of reasoning are valid. I conclude by discussing
how one can use FNC to infer how densely we should expect intelligent species to occur, and by
examining recent anthropic arguments in inﬂationary and string theory cosmology.

1 Introduction

Accounting for selection eﬀects is clearly necessary when drawing conclusions from empirical
data. A poll conducted by telephone, for example, will not tell us the opinions of people who
don’t have telephones. This simple observation has been seen by some, beginning with Bran-
don Carter (1974), as having profound cosmological implications, expressed as the Anthropic
Principle — “what we can expect to observe must be restricted by the conditions necessary
for our presence as observers”. One typical cosmological application of the Anthropic Principle
is in “explaining” the observed values of physical constants by assuming that they take on all
possible values in a multiplicity of universes, but that we of course must observe values that are

1

compatible with the existence of life. A related use of the Anthropic Principle is to deny that a
cosmological theory in which life is common should be considered more probable (other things
being equal) than one in which life is rare, as long as the latter theory gives high probability to
the existence of at least one intelligent observer.

There is a large literature on the Anthropic Principle, much of it too confused to address.
A coherent probabilistic account of the issues involved has been presented by Nick Bostrom
(2002, 2005), whose views of the subject I consider worth critiquing. Ken Olum’s (2002, 2004)
views are also interesting, and are sometimes closer to my own. Leonard Susskind (2006) and
Leo Smolin (2006) have contrasting views on the cosmological implications of the Anthropic
Principle, which I discuss at the end of this paper.

1.1 Four puzzles and two assumptions

One formalization of the intuition regarding observer selection eﬀects is what Bostrom calls the
“Self-Sampling Assumption” (SSA):

(SSA) One should reason as if one were a random sample from the set of all observers
in one’s reference class. (Bostrom 2002, p. 57)

Bostrom regards this as a preliminary formulation; in particular, he later considers more ﬁne-
grained “observer moments”. However, all forms of SSA require some speciﬁcation of an ap-
propriate “reference class” (eg, all humans, or all intelligent observers), and hence are poorly
deﬁned if no precise basis for specifying such a class is given.

Despite this diﬃculty, something like SSA might appear to be essential in order to deal with

the Freak Observers problem:

How can vast-world cosmologies have any observational consequences at all? We
shall show that these cosmologies imply, or give very high probability to, the propo-
sition that every possible observation is in fact made. (Bostrom 2002, p. 52)

Bostrom argues that in a suﬃciently large universe, brains in any possible state will be emitted
as Hawking radiation from black holes, or condense from gas clouds as a result of large thermal
ﬂuctuations. We need not consider such extreme possibilities in order to see a problem, however.
Scientiﬁc experiments commonly have some small probably of producing incorrect results for
more mundane reasons. In a large enough universe, it is likely that some observer has made a
misleading observation of any quantity of interest. So, for example, that some observer in the
universe has made observations that with high conﬁdence could be produced only if the cosmic
microwave background radiation is anisotropic is no reason at all to think that the background
radiation is actually anisotropic. If we are to draw any conclusions from observations we make,
we need to see them not just as observations that have been made, but as observations that have
been made by us. Bostrom argues that SSA together with the fact that most observations made
are not misleading then allows us to conclude that our observations are likely to be correct.

However,

if we accept SSA, we are led to the Doomsday Argument expounded by John
Leslie (1996), who attributes it to Carter. The Doomsday Argument says that your ordinary
estimate of the chance of early human extinction (based on factors such as your assessment of the
probability of an asteroid colliding with earth) should be increased to account for an observer
selection eﬀect.
It is claimed that the circumstance of your being (roughly) the 60 billionth

2

human to ever exist is more likely if there will never be more than a few hundred billion humans
than if there will be hundreds of trillions of humans, as will be the case if humanity survives
and colonizes the galaxy. This argument implicitly assumes SSA. (If the reference class is all
intelligent observers, the argument requires that uncertainty in time of extinction be shared with
other intelligent species.)

Although Leslie (1996), Carter (2004), and some others accept the Doomsday Argument as
valid, I take it to be absurd, primarily because the answer it produces depends arbitrarily on
the choice of reference class. Bostrom (2002) argues that this choice is analogous to a choice of
prior in Bayesian inference, which many are untroubled by. However, a Bayesian prior reﬂects
beliefs about the world. A choice of reference class has no connection to factual beliefs, but
instead reﬂects an ethical judgement, if it reﬂects anything. It is thus unreasonable for such a
choice to inﬂuence our beliefs about facts of the world.

The challenge is therefore to explain exactly why the Doomsday Argument is invalid, without
also destroying our ability to draw conclusion from empirical data despite the possibility of freak
observers. Many refutations of the Doomsday Argument have been attempted, but as argued by
Bostrom (2002, Chapter 7), most of these refutations are themselves ﬂawed. In particular, it is
not enough to adduce plausible-sounding principles that if correct would defuse the Doomsday
Argument if these same principles produce unacceptable results in other contexts.

One way of avoiding the conclusion of the Doomsday Argument is to accept the “Self-
Indication Assumption” (SIA) — that we should take our own existence as evidence that the
number of observers in our reference class is more likely to be large than small. The eﬀect of
SIA is to cancel the eﬀect of SSA in the Doomsday Argument, leaving our beliefs about hu-
man extinction unchanged from whatever they were originally. I refer to this combination as
SSA+SIA, and to SSA with a denial of SIA as SSA−SIA. Bostrom (2002) argues that SIA can-
not be correct because of the Presumptuous Philosopher problem. Consider two cosmological
theories, A and B, of equal plausibility in light of ordinary evidence. Suppose theory A predicts
that there are about ten trillion intelligent species in the universe, whereas theory B predicts
that there are only about ten intelligent species. A presumptuous philosopher who accepts SIA
would decide that theory A was a trillion times more likely than theory B, and would continue to
believe theory A despite virtually any experimental evidence against it, since the chance that the
experiments apparently refuting A were fraudulently or incompetently performed, or produced
misleading results just by chance, is surely much greater than one in a trillion.

Denying SIA also seems as if it might lead to problems, however. The Sleeping Beauty
problem (Elga 2000) sets up a situation in which the ﬂip of a coin determines whether an
observer experiences a situation once, if the coin lands Heads, or twice (the second time with no
memory of the ﬁrst), if the coin lands Tails. Logic analogous to accepting SSA+SIA leads one to
conclude that upon experiencing this situation, the observer should believe with probability 1/3
that the coin landed Heads, whereas SSA−SIA leads one to conclude that the observer should
assess the probability of Heads as being 1/2. Although some have argued that 1/2 is the correct
answer (Lewis 2001, Bostrom 2006), the arguments that 1/3 is the correct answer appear to
me to be conclusive. These include an argument based on betting considerations, and another
argument I detail below. One might therefore be reluctant to abandon SIA.

To summarize, accepting SSA+SIA produces answers regarding Freak Observers, Sleeping
Beauty, and the Doomsday Argument that I consider reasonable, but seems to produce unrea-

3

sonable results for the Presumptuous Philosopher problem. SSA−SIA also resolves the problem
of Freak Observers, and produces what might seem like reasonable results for the Presumptuous
Philosopher problem, but produces results I consider wrong regarding Sleeping Beauty and the
Doomsday Argument.

1.2 Resolving the puzzles

In this paper, I show that this dilemma can be resolved by abandoning both SSA and SIA.
Both are ad hoc devices with no convincing rationale, and both require a “reference class” of
observers, the selection of which is quite arbitrary. Instead, I advocate consistently applying the
general principle that one should condition on all the evidence available, including all the details
of one’s memory, but without considering “indexical” information regarding one’s place in the
universe (as opposed to what the universe contains). I call this approach “Full Non-indexical
Conditioning” (FNC).

The results using FNC are the same as those found using SSA+SIA, when it is clear how to
apply the latter method. As the problems I consider will illustrate, however, FNC is a more
general and more natural method of inference, and has a clearer justiﬁcation.

To test whether the conclusions found by using FNC or by using alternative principles are
correct, I introduce the device of “companion” observers. For the Sleeping Beauty problem, this
device provides further evidence that the correct answer is obtained by FNC (and by SSA+SIA),
whereas the answer produced by applying SSA−SIA in the manner previously done is incorrect.
Consideration of companion observers also shows that SSA−SIA produces unacceptable results
when used with certain reference classes, including the narrow reference classes that have pre-
viously been used for the Sleeping Beauty problem.

When considering the Freak Observers and Presumptuous Philosopher problems, I advocate
restricting consideration to cosmological theories in which the universe may be very large, but
not so large that it is likely to contain multiple observers with exactly the same memories. The
problem of Freak Observers can then be resolved using FNC, without any need for SSA. I argue
that as a general methodological principle, one must be cautious of pushing thought experiments
to extremes, as this has produced spurious paradoxical results in other contexts. I do consider
the possibility of inﬁnite universes later, in connection with inﬂationary cosmology.

I argue that there are actually two versions of the Presumptuous Philosopher problem, with
possibly diﬀerent answers. When comparing theories diﬀering in the density of observers, but not
in the size of the universe, consideration of companion observers provides good reason to doubt
the results found using SSA−SIA, whereas the results of applying SSA+SIA or FNC appear
correct. I argue that no clear conclusions can be drawn from the Presumptuous Philosopher
problem when the theories compared diﬀer in the size of the universe. The Presumptuous
philosopher problem therefore fails to provide a reason to reject SSA+SIA or FNC.

1.3 Applying FNC to cosmology

After showing that FNC provides reasonable answers for each of the four problems described
above, I use FNC to estimate how densely we should expect intelligent observers to occur in
the galaxy. This discussion is not entirely a priori, but is based also on the observed lack of

4

extraterrestrials in our vicinity, both now, and as far as we can tell, in the past. The results I
obtain shed some light on the “Fermi Paradox” — there are reasons to think extraterrestrials
should be common in the universe, but if so, where are they? My conclusions imply some
pessimism regarding our future prospects, but this is of a milder degree than that produced by
the Doomsday Argument, and follows from empirical evidence, not anthropic reasoning.

I conclude by discussing the implications of FNC for anthropic arguments relating to inﬂa-
tionary cosmology, which favours a universe or universes of inﬁnite extent, and to cosmologies
based on string theory, in which a multiplicity of universes populate a “landscape” of diﬀering
physical laws.

2 Methodology

Before discussing the four problems of anthropic reasoning mentioned above, a general exami-
nation of the methodology to be employed seems desirable.

2.1 The nature of probabilities

First, since all these problems involve probabilistic answers, one may ask what these probabilities
mean. I interpret probabilities as justiﬁed subjective degrees of belief — subjective in that they
depend on the information (including prior information) available to the subject, and justiﬁed
in that they follow from correct principles of reasoning, rather than being capricious.

Probabilistic beliefs about scientiﬁc hypotheses (eg, whether or not earth-like planets are
common in the universe) are based partly on our prior assessments of plausibility. Often, such
hypotheses are guesses about the implications of some more fundamental theory, whose true
implications cannot be computed exactly, but for which approximations and mathematical in-
tuition provide some guide. We modify these prior beliefs according to how successfully these
hypotheses account for observations (eg, of whether nearby stars have planets).

The probabilistic nature of most predictions may be due to at least four sources:

1) Inherent randomness in physical phenomena.

2) Ignorance about the initial conditions of physical phenomena.

3) Ignorance about our place in the universe.

4) Inability to fully deduce the consequences of a theory.

These possible sources of uncertainty are not mutually exclusive. At least (1), (2), and (4) are
common sources of uncertainty in ordinary scientiﬁc reasoning. One’s interpretation of quantum
mechanics determines whether “random” quantum phenomena are seen as examples of (1), in
the Copenhagen interpretation, or of (3), in the Many Worlds interpretation. Leaving aside
the technicalities of the interpretation of this particular theory, one might generally take the
ontological position that any apparently random choice is actually made in all possible ways, in
parallel universes, all of which are real (though perhaps with diﬀerent “weights”, corresponding
to the probabilities of the choices), thereby converting physical randomness to ignorance about
which parallel universe we are in.

5

In trying to resolve the puzzles of anthropic reasoning addressed in the paper, it seems best to
not also attempt to resolve issues regarding the nature of probability in physical theories. I will
look for a solution based on fairly common sense notions, presuming that these will in essence
survive any ﬁnal resolution of issues such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics. In thought
experiments, I will follow convention by usually talking about choices that are determined by
a coin ﬂip, whose randomness likely derives from source (2). The reader may, however, replace
this with uncertainty of another type, such as whether the 1,341,735’th digit of π is even or odd,
assuming that this digit is not already known to the people involved.

2.2 Indexical information and reference classes

A central feature of anthropic reasoning is the use of “indexical” information that certain obser-
vations were not just made, but were made by you. Another expression of this concept is that
you should consider not just “possible worlds”, but “possible centred worlds”, in which your
location in the universe is speciﬁed (Lewis 1979).

Both SSA and SIA involve the indexical information that you are members of a certain
reference class. The conclusions that follow from these principles individually are sensitive to
the choice of this reference class. Interestingly, however, when both SSA and SIA are assumed,
this dependence disappears, as long as the reference class is broad enough to encompass all
observers who could possibly have observed what you have observed.

Let C and C ′ be two references classes of observers. Let D be the set of observers who
I will assume here that D ⊆ C and D ⊆ C ′ —
have observed the same data as you have.
ie, the data you observed indicates that you yourself are a member of both of these reference
classes.
I will also use the symbol D to denote the event that you are in the set D. Let A
and B be two mutually-exclusive hypotheses about the universe, each of which speciﬁes the
numbers of observers in C, C ′, and D. Suppose that based on prior information of the usual
sort, P (A) = P (B) = 1/2. If A is true, the number of observers in class C is |C|A and the
number in class C ′ is |C ′|A; if B is true, these numbers are |C|B and |C ′|B. If A is true, the
number of observers in D is |D|A; if B is true, this number is |D|B.

If we assume SSA with reference class C, but not SIA, the probability of hypothesis A given

the observed data is

P (A| D) =

P (A) P (D | A)

P (A) P (D | A) + P (B) P (D | B)

=

(1/2) (|D|A/|C|A)

(1/2) (|D|A/|C|A) + (1/2) (|D|B /|C|B)

(1)

(2)

If we instead use reference class C ′, P (A| D) will be given by this formula with |C ′|A and |C ′|B
replacing |C|A and |C|B. The result will in general be diﬀerent.

However, if we assume SSA+SIA, the prior probabilities for A and B are modiﬁed in propor-
tion to the number of observers they imply are in the reference class. This gives the following
formula for P (A| D) when the reference class is C:

P (A| D) =

(|C|A/2) (|D|A/|C|A)

(|C|A/2) (|D|A/|C|A) + (|C|B/2) (|D|B /|C|B)

=

(1/2)|D|A

(1/2)|D|A + (1/2)|D|B

(3)

6

Since |C|A and |C|B cancel, the identical result is obtained if C ′ is used as the reference class.
This lack of dependence on the reference class suggests that even if the right result is obtained
by assuming both SSA and SIA, the joint aﬃrmation of these two principles may not be the
most illuminating way of describing the logic leading to this result.

2.3 Full Non-indexical Conditioning (FNC)

I advocate probabilistic reasoning by the standard method of fully conditioning on all information
that you possess. Of course, in most ordinary circumstances, you can ignore much information
that you know is not relevant to the problem — eg, when predicting tomorrow’s weather, you
should condition on the current barometric pressure (if you know it), but there is no need to
also condition on the name of your kindergarten teacher (even if you still remember it). When
in doubt, however, it is always correct to conditional on additional information, since if this
information is in fact irrelevant, conditioning on it will not change the result.

When dealing with puzzling instances of anthropic reasoning, what is relevant and irrelevant
is unclear, so I maintain that you should condition on everything you know — your entire set of
memories — to be sure of getting the right answer. You might also condition on the indexical
information that these are your memories. However, I will here consider what happens if you
ignore such indexical information, conditioning only on the fact that someone in the universe
with your memories exists. I refer to this procedure as “Full Non-indexical Conditioning” (FNC).

Some ordinary situations might appear to require use of indexical information, but a closer
examination shows that FNC produces the correct answer in these cases. For instance, suppose
that you and some number of other people are recruited as subjects for an experiment. You
do not know the number of subjects for this experiment, but based on your knowledge of the
budget limitations in the ﬁeld of experimental philosophy, you have a prior distribution for this
number, N , that is uniform over the integers from 1 to 20. You and the other subjects are taken
to separate rooms, without seeing each other, where you are instructed to ﬂip a fair coin three
times and record the sequence of Heads and Tails obtained. You record the sequence HTT. On
the basis of this new data, what should be your posterior distribution for N ?

An invalid way of reasoning here is to condition on the fact that the sequence HTT was
recorded by a subject of the experiment, and on that basis conclude that your posterior distri-
bution should be

P (N = n| HTT recorded) =

=

=

P (N = n) P (HTT recorded| N = n)
P∞
n′=1 P (N = n′) P (HTT recorded| N = n′)
P (N = n) (1 − P (HTT not recorded| N = n))
P∞
n′=1 P (N = n′) (1 − P (HTT not recorded| N = n′))
(1/20) (1 − (1 − 2−3)n)
P20
n′=1 (1/20) (1 − (1 − 2−3)n′)

(4)

(5)

(6)

These probabilities vary from 0.0093 for n = 1 to 0.0690 for n = 20. Intuitively, these probabili-
ties seem wrong, for two reasons. First, since you had to record some sequence of ﬂips, it seems
that knowledge of the particular sequence you recorded shouldn’t change your beliefs about N .
On the other hand, it seems that the fact that you were recruited for the experiment should
increase the probability that there are many subjects (by more than happens above).

7

The problem is ﬁxed if you take account of the indexical information that it was you who
recorded the sequence HTT. The probability of this sequence being obtained by you is 2−3
regardless of N . On the other hand, if the pool of possible experimental subjects is of size M
(assumed to be greater than 20), the probability that you will be recruited as a subject if there
are n subjects is n/M . The posterior distribution for N that results is

P (N = n| You were recruited and recorded HTT) =

(1/20) (n/M ) 2−3

n′=1 (1/20) (n′/M ) 2−3

n′=1 n′ = n / 210

(7)

(8)

P20

= n / P20

These probabilities vary from 0.0048 for n = 1 to 0.0952 for n = 20.

This answer is also obtained if we condition on all non-indexical information. We know not
just that the sequence HTT was recorded, but also that it was recorded by a subject of your
age, with your hair colour, who went to a school just like yours, who has your taste in music,
who has the same opinion of rice pudding as you do, etc. The probability that the i’th subject
recruited for the experiment will have all these characteristics is some very small number, ǫ. The
probability that the i’th subject has these characteristics and also records coin ﬂips of HTT is
ǫ 2−3. Since this probability is extremely small, the probability that any of n subjects will have
these characteristics and record those ﬂips is very well approximated by n ǫ 2−3. Conditioning
on all non-indexical information therefore produces the following posterior distribution for N :

P (N = n| all non-indexical information) =

(1/20) n ǫ 2−3
n′=1 (1/20) n ǫ 2−3

n′=1 n′ = n / 210

P20

= n / P20

(9)

(10)

This is the same result as found above using indexical information.

Use of indexical information therefore seems unnecessary in ordinary situations, since the non-
indexical information regarding your memories is normally suﬃcient to uniquely identify you.
SSA can perhaps be seen as arising from what might be called “Full Indexical Conditioning”, in
which we assume that in addition to their memories, everyone also has some unique “essence”,
and everyone in some sense knows what their own essence is. One could then argue that you
should condition not only on your memories, but also on having your own essence, which by
assumption is shared with no one else. Conditioning on more than FNC rather than less seems
the only way of reconciling SSA−SIA with the fundamental principle that probabilistic inferences
should be based on all known information. I will illustrate this idea when discussing Sleeping
Beauty in Section 3.2.
It seems preferable to me to not introduce such mystical “essences”
unless ignoring them can be shown to produce implausible results. Moreover, if one does think
in terms of such essences, it seems hard not to proceed to acceptance of SIA as well as SSA,
which eﬀectively renders thoughts of essences pointless, as I will now explain.

It turns out that if the universe is not excessively huge, using SSA+SIA produces the same
results as using FNC. Consider the situation with two hypotheses, A and B, discussed above in
Section 2.2. Assume now that you condition on all information you remember, and that these
memories are extensive enough that there is only a small probability that an observer with your
memories would exist, under either hypothesis. Let |C|A and |C|B be the numbers of observers in
some suitable reference class (whose members “might have had” your memories) if hypotheses

8

A and B are true, respectively. Let ǫA and ǫB be the (extremely small) probabilities that a
particular observer in this reference class will have your memories under hypotheses A and B.
Suppose that you assess the prior probability of A and B as P (A) = P (B) = 1/2, where this
prior is based on your scientiﬁc knowledge, but not on the multitude of details of your life that
make you unique. Applying SIA will shift these priors to P (A) = (|C|A/2) / (|C|A/2 + |C|B/2)
and P (B) = (|C|B/2) / (|C|A/2 + |C|B/2). Applying SSA, the probability that you will have
your memories is ǫA if hypothesis A is true, and ǫB if hypothesis B is true. The result of applying
both SIA and SSA is therefore

P (A| all your memories)

ǫA (|C|A/2) / (|C|A/2 + |C|B/2)

ǫA (|C|A/2) / (|C|A/2 + |C|B/2) + ǫB (|C|B/2) / (|C|A/2 + |C|B/2)

=

=

ǫA |C|A

ǫA |C|A + ǫB |C|B

(11)

(12)

Provided that ǫA |C|A and ǫB |C|B are both close to zero (as they will be if the universe is not
excessively huge), the same result will be obtained by applying FNC — ǫA |C|A and ǫB |C|B are
then very close to the probabilities of any observer with your memories existing under hypotheses
A and B, respectively, which given the equal prior probabilities of A and B produces the same
result as above found using SSA and SIA.

FNC is a more general principle of inference than SSA and SIA, however, since it does not
require any notion of a reference class. FNC requires only that there be some way of comput-
ing the probability that an observer with your memories will exist. As was done above, it is
convenient to separate your scientiﬁc memories (which may be shared with many others) from
the rest of your memories, which make you a unique observer. Conditioning on your scientiﬁc
memories converts whatever primitive prior distribution you had regarding scientiﬁc theories
to what would ordinarily be regarded as your prior. We can then consider how this prior is
altered by conditioning on subsequent scientiﬁc observations and on the memories that make
you unique.

Note that the probabilities involved in FNC need not derive from some random physical
process, but may simply reﬂect ignorance or an inability to fully deduce the consequences of
known facts. This will be discussed further in Section 6.2.

2.4 Assessing arguments by considering companion observers

If your opinions diﬀer from those of an intelligent friend who possesses the same information as
you, you should question the validity of the reasoning that led you to these opinions. Ultimately,
after exchanging information and fully discussing the matter with your friend, you should expect
to come to the same conclusions regarding factual matters. Persistent disagreements might seem
possible due to diﬀering prior beliefs, but as discussed by Hanson (2006), this is possible for fully
rational observers only if they disagree about the processes by which they came to hold these
prior beliefs. Agreement with hypothetical friends has been used as a test of reasoning in the
past — in particular, Nozick (1969) uses it in his discussion of Newcomb’s Problem, as described
in the next section.

I propose here to test the validity of anthropic arguments by comparing the conclusions of

9

such arguments with those that imaginary “companion” observers would reach, using the same
principles of reasoning (eg, acceptance of SSA but not SIA). Of course, it is possible that several
incompatible sets of principles might each lead to consistency with the conclusions of companions
reasoning by these same principles, so this test may sometimes fail to fully resolve the issues.

By considering possible companions, a general constraint on the use of SSA−SIA can be
derived. Suppose there exist two types of observers, X and Y . These observers are considering
two theories, A and B, according to which the numbers of observers of these types are |X|A and
|Y |A, for theory A, and |X|B and |Y |B, for theory B. There is a pairing observers of type X with
companion observers of type Y , in which each observer is paired with at most one companion
observer. If |X| = |Y |, all observers have companions; otherwise, some observers of the more
numerous type are unpaired.

Suppose that all observers consider theories A and B to be equally likely based on the usual
sorts of evidence (ie, without applying SSA or SIA). Now consider what those observers with
companions will conclude by applying SSA−SIA using as their reference class only observers of
their own type, and taking account of their knowledge that they were paired with a companion
observer of the other type. Observers of type X will reason that their chance of having a
companion observer is min(1,|Y |A/|X|A) if theory A is true, and min(1,|Y |B/|X|B) if theory B
is true. The odds an observer of type X assigns to theory A over theory B will therefore be

min(1,|Y |A/|X|A)
min(1,|Y |B/|X|B)

=

1
if |Y |A ≥ |X|A and |Y |B ≥ |X|B
|Y |A / |X|A
if |Y |A ≤ |X|A and |Y |B ≥ |X|B

Since these are generally not equal, we see that companions will disagree in this scenario if they
each reason with SSA−SIA using as their reference class only observers of their own type.

However, these companion observers will agree if they apply SSA−SIA using as their reference
class all observers of both types, because of the eﬀects of a Doomsday-like argument, of a sort
discussed further in Section 4.3. Observers of type X will reason that their chances, applying
SSA, of being of type X are |X|A/(|X|A + |Y |A) if theory A is true, and |X|B/(|X|B + |Y |B)
if theory B is true. The odds in favour of theory A are therefore multiplied by (|X|A/|X|B) ×
(|X|B + |Y |B)/(|X|A + |Y |A). Multiplying equation (13) by this factor, we get that an observer
of type X having a companion will consider the odds in favour of theory A to be

Similarly, multiplying equation (14) by (|Y |A/|Y |B) × (|X|B + |Y |B)/(|X|A + |Y |A) gives the
odds in favour of theory A for an observer of type Y with a companion, which turn out to be
identical to the odds above.

This computation shows that requiring consistency with conclusions of a companion imposes
a constraint on the reference class used with SSA−SIA — the companions must use the same
reference class, which must therefore include both of them. This constraint might be seen
as making anthropic arguments based on SSA−SIA less arbitrary, and hence more attractive.
However, this constraint also makes it harder to apply such arguments, since to chose a suitable
reference class, you must know the full set of observers with whom you would expect to agree.

In contrast, SSA+SIA produces consistent results even when observers use reference classes
that include only their own type of observer, excluding their companion. This may be conﬁrmed
by multiplying equation (13) by |X|A/|X|B and equation (14) by |Y |A/|Y |B, the factors by
which SIA modiﬁes the prior odds. Companion observers applying FNC will obviously produce
consistent conclusions, since FNC does not involve indexical information, and companions are
assumed to share all non-indexical information.

2.5 The dangers of fantastic assumptions

Several of the puzzles treated here employ thought experiments, and make other arguments,
that are based on hypothetical and perhaps fantastic assumptions. This can sometimes produce
spurious conclusions. We may accept a fantastic assumption, on the basis that although it isn’t
true in reality, it “might be true”, and then proceed to reason utilizing other premises that are
based on the reality that we have implicitly rejected in making the fantastic assumption.

Searle’s (1980) Chinese Room Argument provides one example. He argues that a computer
cannot possibly understand Chinese. Any program that enabled a computer to understand
Chinese could in principle be executed by a person in a room who takes inputs from a window,
follows certain simple rules for shuﬄing tokens about, and shoves results out another window.
The person executing this program need have no understanding of Chinese to begin with, and
is unlikely to acquire any understanding of Chinese by performing the tasks needed to execute
this program. So, the argument goes, a computer running such a program will also not really
understand Chinese, regardless of whether it might superﬁcially appear to.

A common (and in my view, correct) response is that although the person executing the
program does not understand Chinese, the system of person plus room is a physical embodiment
of another entity that does understand Chinese. To this, a defender of the Chinese Room
Argument may reply that, in principle, the room is unnecessary — a person with a suﬃciently
good memory could execute the program entirely in their head, without the need of any physical
tokens. To the subsequent objection that this just means that the new entity is physically
contained in the same body as the original person, Harnad (2001) has mockingly replied

This was tantamount to conjecturing that, as a result of memorizing and manipulat-
ing very many meaningless symbols, Chinese-understanding would be induced either
consciously in Searle, or, multiple-personality-style, in another, conscious Chinese-
understanding entity inside his head of which Searle was unaware.

I will not dwell on any of these heroics; suﬃce it to say that even Creationism could
be saved by ad hoc speculations of this order.

11

In a seminar I attended in the 1990’s, Harnad explained in more detail that the psychiatric
literature on multiple personality disorder contains no recorded case of such a second being,
with totally diﬀerent language and other capabilities, existing within someone’s head.

This is an extreme case of making a fantastic assumption and then reasoning with premises
that contradict it. Any program capable of appearing to understand Chinese will very likely re-
quire a computer at least as powerful as those available today to execute in real time. Compared
to manual execution by a person, today’s computers are at least a billion times faster, and have
at least a billion times as much readily-available memory.1 The characteristics of a hypothetical
person whose computational abilities are a billion times greater than those of ordinary people
are certainly not going to be obvious to us, or deducible from the current psychiatric literature.
To assume the existence of such a person and then claim incredulity at a consequence of their
existence abuses the hospitality of one’s interlocutor in conceding that “in principle” a computer
program can be executed manually — when in reality, this is true only of programs no more
than a few pages long, that operate for no more than a few hundred steps.

A more subtle example of the dangers of fantastic thought experiments is provided by New-
comb’s Problem, ﬁrst discussed in print by Nozick (1969). We imagine that a wealthy “Pre-
dictor”, who is very good at predicting human behaviour, conducts a “game” that operates as
follows. A person is randomly selected to participate, and is then shown two boxes. They are
told that the ﬁrst box contains $1000, and the other box contains either $1,000,000 or $0. The
participant may either take both boxes, or take just the second box, and receives all the money
in the box or boxes they take. The Predictor puts $1,000,000 in the second box if and only if
he predicts that the participant will take only this box. Suppose that you have seen the game
played many times, and are convinced that the Predictor’s predictions are almost certain to be
correct. If you are selected to be a participant in this game, should you take both boxes, or only
the second box?

The argument for taking only the second box is that you are then almost certain to receive
$1,000,000, whereas if you take both boxes, you almost certainly will receive only $1000. (Con-
ceivably, you might receive $1,001,000 if you take both boxes, but only if the Predictor is wrong,
which you know is very unlikely.) The argument for taking both boxes is that you will then
receive $1000 more than you would if you took only the second box, regardless of whether the
Predictor was right or wrong in his prediction, which he has already made. Nozick (1969) favours
taking both boxes, strengthening this argument by pointing out that if a friend of yours could
see into both boxes, they would certainly advise you to take both of them. Actually, your friend
cannot see into the boxes, or if they can, they aren’t allowed to advise you, but you know what
advice your friend would give if they could, and you should follow this advice.

I would ﬁnd the argument for taking two boxes convincing, if it were not for a matter that
seems to have been overlooked in the philosophical literature2 — How does the Predictor make
such accurate predictions?

1I refer here to the speed and memory available when a person consciously carries out the simple tasks needed
to execute the steps of a computer program. The computational power that underlies unconscious functions of
our brains likely exceeds that of today’s computers.

2I wrote a paper on this idea twenty years ago, which was rejected by Mind, though verbal discus-
sions with philosophers over the years have been more positive. At least two other people have thought
of this idea independently — Scott Aaronson described the idea in a November 2005 blog posting at
http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/2005/11/dude-its-like-you-read-my-mind.html, and someone going by
the name of “Count Iblis” wrote about it in a December 2005 blog posting at http://countiblis.blogspot.com.

12

Superﬁcially, assuming the existence of such an accurate Predictor may not seem too extreme.
We all predict other people’s actions every day, often successfully. However, we also have a strong
sense that we have free will, and that our will is integrated with our whole being — for example,
that any part of our memories can potentially aﬀect our actions. Hence, while some of our
actions are easy to predict, other actions could only be predicted with high accuracy by a being
who has knowledge of almost every detail of our memories and inclinations, and who uses this
knowledge to simulate how we will act in a given situation. To predict whether a participant will
take one box or two (which for at least some people must be a diﬃcult behaviour to predict),
the Predictor must have some way of measuring with high accuracy the relevant aspects of
the participant’s brain (at some time prior to when the game is played) and a very powerful
computer that can simulate the participant’s mental processes.3

Now we can see why Newcomb’s Problem involves an extreme fantastic assumption — the
only plausible mechanism for accurate prediction involves brain measurements and simulations
that are far beyond our current ability, and that may be impossible in principle, if quantum
eﬀects are crucial to how the brain works (since non-destructive copying of quantum states
is not possible).4 This fantastic assumption has a crucial consequence — the simulation the
Predictor conducts in order to predict your choice will (if you accept a functionalist view of
consciousness) create another conscious being, and you have no way of knowing that you are not
this being. If you are the being in the simulation, your “choice” has a causal eﬀect on whether
the Predictor puts $1,000,000 or $0 in the second box. Supposing that the simulated “you” has
sympathy for the real “you”, or perhaps that “you” intended to donate the money to a worthy
charity all along, it is now clear that you should take only the second box, since that may cause
the real “you” to obtain $1,000,000, and at worse costs the real “you” only $1000. Note that the
argument involving advice from a friend loses its force once the situation is really understood.
Your friend may not actually be there (if you are being simulated, but he is not), and if he is
(and understands the situation), he will advise you to take only the second box.

Possible problems with overly fantastic assumptions arise with several of the problems dis-
cussed below. We should also be careful to keep the “companion” observers of the previous
section from becoming too fantastic, at least with respect to their cognitive and other relevant
characteristics (though other fantastic aspects may be innocuous).

3 Sleeping Beauty

The Sleeping Beauty problem is described by Elga (2000). On Sunday, Beauty is put to sleep.
On Monday she is woken, then later put to sleep again. While she is awake, she does not have
access to any information that would help her infer the day of the week. If a ﬂip of a fair coin
lands Tails, Beauty is woken again on Tuesday, but only after she is administered a drug that

3Note that we needn’t assume that this simulation is absolutely accurate, if we allow that the Predictor may be
wrong with some tiny probability. Quite large ﬁnal error rates would be compatible with the Newcomb scenario
as long most errors are introduced by the Predictor’s careless assistant, after a highly accurate simulation has
been run. Such errors would be uncorrelated with the type of participant, and hence you would not be justiﬁed
in feeling that you in particular might be able to “beat the game”. However, errors due to faulty simulation that
arise when, for example, a participant thinks of one particular argument would undermine the Newcomb scenario.
4One might object that some other mechanism for accurate prediction not involving simulation might be pos-
sible. However, Nozick speciﬁcally excludes mechanisms, such as time travel, that introduce backward causation.
The onus is on someone wishing us to take the problem seriously as a paradox to provide at least a hint of how
such accurate predictions might be obtained with neither accurate simulation nor backward causation.

13

causes her to forget her Monday awakening (leaving her memories in the same state as they were
after falling asleep on Sunday). Again, she obtains no information that would reveal the day of
the week. Regardless of how the coin lands, Beauty is woken on Wednesday, and immediately
told that the experiment is over. Beauty knows that this is how the experiment is set up. When
Beauty wakens before Wednesday, what probability should she assign to the coin landing Heads?

3.1 The 1/2 and 1/3 answers

Some (eg, Lewis 2001) argue that on Sunday Beauty should certainly assign probability 1/2 to
the coin landing Heads, that upon wakening she acquires no additional information (since she
knew that she would experience such an awakening regardless of how the coin lands), and that
she should therefore still consider the probability of Heads to be 1/2 at this time.

Others (eg, Elga 2000) argue instead that Beauty should assign probability 1/3 to the coin
landing Heads upon wakening before Wednesday. One argument for this is that if the experiment
were repeated many times, 1/3 of the wakenings before Wednesday would occur when the coin
lands Heads (since Beauty wakens twice when it lands Tails, and only once when it lands Heads).
This view can be reinforced by supposing that on each awakening Beauty is oﬀered a bet in which
she wins 2 dollars if the coin lands Tails and loses 3 dollars if it lands Heads. (We suppose that
Beauty knows such a bet will always be oﬀered.) Beauty would not accept this bet if she assigns
probability 1/2 to Heads. If she assigns a probability of 1/3 to Heads, however, her expected
gain is 2 × (2/3) − 3 × (1/3) = 1/3, so she will accept, and if the experiment is repeated many
times, she will come out ahead. Furthermore, she can work all this out on Sunday, at which
time she will wish herself to accept these bets later on. Accepting the argument that she should
assign probability 1/2 to Heads when she is woken later therefore requires that we accept that
Beauty should override her previous decision, even though she has no new knowledge that would
justify such a change. This seems at least as strange as accepting that Beauty should alter her
probability of Heads from 1/2 to 1/3 even though nothing unexpected has apparently happened.

A problem with Lewis’s argument for the probability of Heads being 1/2 arises if we change
the experiment so that some time after being woken on Monday, Beauty is told that it is Monday.
If she assigned probability 1/2 to Heads just before being told this, standard Bayesian updating
of probabilities would lead her to assign probability 2/3 to Heads after being told it is Monday
— the probability of Monday given Heads is 1, whereas the probability of Monday given Tails
is 1/2; this factor of two diﬀerence shifts the previous equal probabilities for Heads and Tails
so that Heads has twice the probability of Tails. This seems ridiculous, however, given that at
this point, Beauty knows nothing of relevance that would distinguish her from any other person
who has gotten a good night’s sleep, and is then asked to predict the toss of a fair coin. That
she knows this coin toss will determine whether her memory is erased in the future should be
of no relevance. Elga’s (2000) argument for the 1/3 view is essentially to work backwards from
the assumption that Beauty should assign probability 1/2 to Heads if she is in this situation.5

5Bostrom (2006) argues that Beauty should assign probability 1/2 to Heads both before and after being told
on Monday that it is Monday. He justiﬁes this non-reaction to new information on the basis that there is a shift
in reference class on being told that it is Monday. This argument involves the use of narrow reference classes
which I argue below are untenable. Bostrom also argues that the betting argument can be defused by further
consideration of reference classes and indexical information, but his reasoning applies only if repetitions of the
experiment are done with Beauty’s memory being erased between each repetition. This is unconvincing, since
one can equally well suppose that Beauty remembers how many times the experiment was previously done.

3.2 Relating Sleeping Beauty to SSA, SIA, and FNC

These diﬀering answers to the Sleeping Beauty problem can be viewed as consequences of apply-
ing SSA+SIA or SSA−SIA, with the reference class being instances of Beauty upon wakening
before Wednesday. With SSA−SIA, Heads and Tails are equally likely a priori, and Beauty’s
observations on wakening before Wednesday are equally likely given Heads or Tails — if Heads,
there is only one possible wakening, if Tails there are two, and SSA tells us that they are equally
likely, but in any case they do not diﬀer in any identiﬁable way. Heads and Tails are therefore
still equally likely once Beauty has woken. If we accept SSA+SIA, however, Heads have prob-
ability 1/3 a priori (once we are in the position of Beauty after wakening, and therefore part
of the reference class), since Heads leads to only half as many members of the reference class
as Tails. The observations on wakening are still equally likely given Heads or Tails, so Beauty’s
probability of Heads after wakening should remain 1/3.

As expected from the discussion in Section 2.3, the same conclusion as SSA+SIA is reached
by applying FNC — simply conditioning on the full data available to Beauty upon wakening. In
this regard, note that the even though the experiences of Beauty upon wakening on Monday and
upon wakening on Tuesday (if she is woken then) are identical in all “relevant” respects, they
will not be subjectively indistinguishable. On Monday, a ﬂy on the wall may crawl upwards; on
Tuesday, it may crawl downwards. Beauty’s physiological state (heart rate, blood glucose level,
etc.) will not be identical, and will aﬀect her thoughts at least slightly. Treating these and other
diﬀerences as random, the probability of Beauty having at some time the exact memories and
experiences she has after being woken this time is twice as great if the coin lands Tails than
if the coin lands Heads, since with Tails there are two chances for these experiences to occur
rather than only one. This computation assumes that the chance on any given day of Beauty
experiencing exactly what she ﬁnds herself experiencing is extremely small, as will be the case
in any realistic version of the experiment.

We can see for Sleeping Beauty how introduction of the “essences” discussed in Section 2.3
together with “Full Indexical Conditioning” changes the result from that of FNC to that of
SSA−SIA. We suppose that instances of Beauty on diﬀerent days have diﬀerent essences. The
probability that an instance of Beauty woken before Wednesday will have both her current
memories and her current unique essence is the same whether she is woken once or twice —
a second awakening doesn’t provide a second chance because Beauty on the other awakening
will have the wrong essence. Denying SIA is equivalent to assuming that the existence of two
awakenings would not increase the probability that an instance of Beauty with her current
essence exists.
In the context of this problem, these assumptions regarding essences seems
rather contrived, but perhaps advocates of SSA−SIA might maintain that essences with these
characteristics are more plausible for the other problems discussed in this paper.

3.3 Beauty and the Prince

Since I maintain that the right results are obtained by using FNC (or SSA+SIA), I would like to
provide further evidence that 1/3 is indeed the correct probability of Heads. For this purpose,
imagine a “companion” of Beauty, the Prince, who is also put to sleep on Sunday, and woken
on Monday. However, unlike Beauty, the Prince is woken on Tuesday regardless of how the coin
lands, after being administered a drug that causes him to forget his Monday awakening. Like
Beauty, he is always woken on Wednesday and told the experiment is over. Beauty and the

15

Prince will be in the same room at all times, and will be free to discuss their situation (if both
are awake). All this is known to both Beauty and the Prince.

If the Prince is woken before Wednesday and ﬁnds that Beauty has also been woken, what
probability should he assign to the coin landing Heads? Quite clearly, he should assign prob-
ability 1/3 to Heads, since given Heads, the probability of Beauty being woken with him is
1/2, whereas given Tails this probability is 1. Since the coin is fair, this factor of two larger
probability of what is observed given Tails should produce a factor of two larger probability of
Tails given the observation that Beauty has been woken too.

The Prince will tell Beauty of his conclusion. Should Beauty disagree, and maintain that the
probability of Heads is actually 1/2? Beauty and the Prince have the same information (and
even if they didn’t, they would after discussing the situation). Beauty will agree that the Prince’s
reasoning is correct, for him. There seem to be no grounds for her to decide that, for her, the
probability should be diﬀerent. Furthermore, if we wish, we can disallow discussions between
Beauty and the Prince — Beauty is intelligent enough to know what the Prince’s conclusion
will be without him having to tell her. Indeed, we can assume that the Prince is hidden from
Beauty by a curtain, as long as she knows he is there. Does it really matter if we go one step
further and eliminate the Prince altogether?

This contradiction between the conclusions reached by Beauty and the Prince when they both
apply SSA−SIA is not surprising in light of the discussion in Section 2.4, since the reference
class used by Beauty does not include instances of the Prince, and vice versa. If instead they
both use the reference class of wakenings before Wednesday of either Beauty or the Prince, the
result of applying SSA−SIA changes. Beauty will then reason on wakening before Wednesday
that if the coin landed Heads, the probability that she will be an instance of Beauty (rather than
the Prince) is 1/3, whereas if the coin landed Tails, this probability will be 2/4, and as a result
assign probability (1/3) /(1/3 + 2/4) = 2/5 to Heads. The Prince reasons on wakening that the
probability of his being an instance of the Prince is 2/3 if the coin landed Heads and 2/4 if it
landed Tails, so the probability of Heads is (2/3) / (2/3 + 2/4) = 4/7, equivalent to odds of 4/3
in favour of Heads. When he sees that Beauty is also awake, his odds shift by a factor of two in
favour of Tails, producing ﬁnal odds of 2/3 for Heads, corresponding to the probability of Heads
being 2/5, which matches the conclusions of Beauty. While these conclusions are consistent, they
appear doubtful because of their novelty, and their sensitivity to the number of companions.

If the reference class used by Beauty and the Prince is expanded to include all wakenings
by all humans, which seems natural, the conclusions of SSA−SIA change again. If there are a
large number, N , of wakenings by other people, and by Beauty or the Prince on other days,
the probability that Beauty will assign to Heads upon wakening before Wednesday will be
(1/(N +3)) / (1/(N +3) + 2/(N +4)) ≈ 1/3. The probability the Prince assigns to Heads upon
wakening will be (2/(N +3)) / (2/(N +3) + 2/(N +4)) ≈ 1/2, which will change to 1/3 (a shift of
odds by a factor of two) when he sees that Beauty is also awake. These conclusions of Beauty
and the Prince are consistent, and match the conclusions obtained using FNC or SSA+SIA.

We therefore see that to obtain the answer 1/2, or any answer other than 1/3, SSA−SIA
must be applied with a narrow reference class. Furthermore, the most natural narrow reference
class — instances of Beauty alone — cannot be used if consistency with the conclusions of a
companion is required. The arguments based on SSA−SIA for the answer 1/2 appear to not
be viable. Any such arguments in favour of some answer other than 1/2 or 1/3 seem arbitrary,

16

and also unmotivated, to the extent that the original intuition in favour of 1/2 — that Beauty
learns nothing when she wakens before Wednesday — is violated by any other answer.

3.4 The Sailor’s Child problem

The issue underlying the Sleeping Beauty problem can be further clariﬁed by looking at what I
will call the Sailor’s Child problem. This problem does not involve memory loss. Without any
such fantastic aspect, we can surely hope to obtain a clear answer.

A Sailor sails regularly between two ports, in each of which he stays with a woman, both
of whom wish to have a child by him. He is reluctant, but eventually decides that he will
have one or two children, with the number decided by a coin toss — one if Heads, two if Tails.
Furthermore, he decides that if the coin lands Heads, he will have a child with the woman who
lives in the city listed ﬁrst in The Sailor’s Guide to Ports. (He considers this fair, since although
he owns a copy of this book, he hasn’t previously read it, and so has no prior knowledge of which
city comes ﬁrst.) Now, suppose that you are this Sailor’s child, and that neither you nor your
mother know whether he had a child with the other woman. You also do not have a copy of
The Sailor’s Guide to Ports. You do, however, know that he decided these matters as described
above. What should you consider to be the probability that you are his only child (ie, that the
coin he tossed landed Heads)?

The answer seems clear. Given your ignorance regarding The Sailor’s Guide to Ports, you
should believe that if the coin landed Heads, your mother would have been selected to have a
child with probability 1/2, whereas if the coin landed Tails, this probability would have been 1.
This 2-to-1 ratio of probabilities for what is observed (that you were born) given Tails versus
Heads leads to the probability of Heads being 1/3. The probability of your having a half-sibling
is therefore 2/3. If you have any doubts about this, due to some idea that you should consider
that you might have been the other child, ask the opinion of your mother, who plays the role of
“companion” in this tale. She should have no doubts about this reasoning.

Suppose that you later obtain a copy of The Sailor’s Guide to Ports, and ﬁnd that the city you
were born in is listed before the other port city. With this additional information, your birth
becomes certain, regardless of the result of the coin ﬂip. You therefore have no information
regarding the result of this ﬂip, and should assign probability 1/2 to Tails, and hence also to the
possibility that you have a half-sibling. This situation is analogous to Beauty being told that it
is Monday sometime after wakening.

Do the Sailor’s Child and Sleeping Beauty problems diﬀer in any important way? In the
Sleeping Beauty problem, the instances of Beauty awakening on Monday and Tuesday can be
visualized as “children” of the Beauty who existed on Sunday. That these “children” are much
more closely related than are real children of the same father seems inessential, particularly since
the only information transferred from Beauty-on-Sunday to Beauty-awakened-later is “common
knowledge” about the setup, such as that the coin is fair. In this light, we can see that contrary
to many treatments in the literature, the Sleeping Beauty problem is not really about updating
of beliefs as new information is received — a procedure that in any case seems dubious when
actual or suspected memory loss is an issue.

Perhaps the puzzlement concerning Sleeping Beauty is partly a consequence of an implicit
assumption that if Beauty is woken on both Monday and Tuesday her subjective experiences

17

will be identical — that she will in essence be a single sentient entity existing at two moments
in time. As mentioned above, this assumption is not justiﬁed by the standard description of the
experiment. And indeed, it is not explicitly used in any of the arguments that I am aware of,
but nevertheless seems to colour thinking about the problem. For example, Lewis (2001, p. 171)
in describing the problem says, “. . . the memory erasure on Monday will make sure that her
total evidence at the Tuesday awakening is exactly the same as at the Monday awakening”, and
Elga (2000, p. 145) says, “We may even suppose that you knew at the start of the experiment
exactly what sensory experiences you would have upon being awakened on Monday”, which
in the context of the problem would require also assuming that these experiences are identical
to those on Tuesday (if one is woken then). Assuming that Beauty’s subjective experiences on
Monday and Tuesday are identical converts the thought experiment from one with an only mildly
fantastic element (perfect memory erasure) to one which is arguably impossible in principle. It
is perhaps not surprising that confusion can then ensue. In the Sailor’s Child problem, however,
no one would assume that if the Sailor has two children their lives will be indistinguishable;
indeed, it is obvious that their lives will diﬀer substantially (diﬀerent mothers, diﬀerent cities,
etc.). That we can imagine the Sleeping Beauty experiment happening with the experiences of
Beauty on Monday and on Tuesday diﬀering only in much less dramatic ways does not change
the correct answer; it only makes it harder to see.

4 The Doomsday Argument

Some versions of the Doomsday Argument, such as that of Gott (1993), depend in essence on
an unsupported intuition — if humanity will expand into the galaxy, with hundreds of trillions
of humans being born, isn’t it rather surprising that you are among the ﬁrst hundred billion
humans? I will deal only with the version due to Leslie (1996), which can be put in formal terms
if SSA is assumed, as discussed by Bostrom (2002).

4.1 Formalizing the Doomsday Argument

Suppose you know that you are the r’th human to be born (knowing r approximately is good
enough, but would complicate the notation). Let N be the (unknown) total number of humans
who will ever be born.
If you assume SSA with the reference class being all humans, the
probability of your observation that your birth rank, R, is r, given that the total number of
humans is n, can be written as

P (R = r | N = n) = ( 1/n if n ≥ r

if n < r

0

(16)

This is a consequence of SSA, since you might equally have been any of the n humans to ever
exist. Suppose that P (N = n) gives your prior belief that a total of n humans will ever be
born, based on information such as your judgement of the probability that a large asteroid
will collide earth, and of the probability that a species that has evolved by natural selection
to be competitive will destroy itself once its members acquire the technological means to do
so. Applying Bayes’ Rule, you can obtain the posterior distribution for N , which on these
assumptions reﬂects what your beliefs about N should be after accounting for both your prior

18

The diﬀerence between the posterior distributions for N given by (18) and (19) can be sub-
stantial. Suppose, for instance, that you believe that we will either destroy ourselves soon, or if
we avoid this fate, we (or our descendants) will go on to colonize the galaxy. This belief would
lead to a prior for N that (when idealized a bit) can be expressed as something like the following:

P (N = n) = 


1/2 if n = 1011
1/2 if n = 1014

otherwise

(20)

If you observe that your birth rank is r = 6× 1010, conditioning on N ≥ r as in (19) produces a
posterior distribution that is the same as the prior. In contrast, conditioning on R = r as in (18)
produces a posterior distribution in which the probability that humanity will colonize the galaxy
is reduced from 1/2 in the prior to (1/2)/1014 / ((1/2)/1011 + (1/2)/1014) = 0.000999001 in
the posterior (or put another way, the odds in favour of colonizing the galaxy change from 1 to
1/1000). Much greater shifts in odds are possible if galactic colonization is assumed to be more
extensive (eg, of 1010 stars, each with population 1010). A large “Doomsday eﬀect” occurs even
if the non-doom scenario involves only full utilization of our solar system.

4.2 Why the Doomsday Argument must be wrong

Although Leslie (1996) considers this shift in probabilities towards doom to be correct, and
Bostrom (2002) does not consider the argument for it to be deﬁnitely refuted, there are several
reasons for rejecting the Doomsday Argument that I regard as convincing, even without a
detailed understanding of why it is wrong.

The biggest problem with the Doomsday Argument is that its conclusion depends critically
on the choice of reference class. Is it all members of the species Homo sapiens? If so, exactly
how is this species deﬁned? Or should earlier extinct species of the genus Homo be included?
Do the other Great Apes (gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans) count? Would they count
if future experiments showed their cognitive abilities were greater than is at present believed
— so that predictions regarding our prospects of colonizing the galaxy depend not just on the

19

latest research into possible mechanisms of interstellar travel, but also on the latest research
into whether apes can learn language?

Such changes in the reference class could easily change the probabilities resulting from the
Doomsday Argument by a factor of ten. The probabilities also change if your belief regarding
your birth rank changes. Suppose we discover that the population of China from 15000 to 5000
years ago was much larger than previously supposed, so that we estimate an extra 1011 people
lived there in the past. If you previously estimated your birth rank as 6 × 1010, you would now
estimate it as 1.6 × 1011. If your previous prior on N was P (N = 1011) = P (N = 1014) = 1/2,
this would likely now change to P (N = 2 × 1011) = P (N = 1014) = 1/2. The result would be
factor of two improvement in the odds in favour of colonizing the galaxy (from 1/1000 to 1/500).
But is it reasonable that the latest results from Chinese archeology should aﬀect your beliefs in
this way?

Looking into the future, how much can our descendants diﬀer from ourselves and still count as
belonging to the reference class? Depending on the answer, the Doomsday Argument argument
might not reduce the chances of our descendants colonizing the galaxy after all, if we think they
would do so only after they start implanting computers in their brains, which might disqualify
them from membership in the chosen reference class. It seems ridiculous that such an ethical
judgement of what counts as “human” would aﬀect our beliefs concerning the factual matter of
whether or not our descendants will colonize the galaxy.

The Doomsday Argument falls apart completely if one sees no reason why SSA should be
applied to individual intelligent observers (or to briefer “observer moments”). Considering that
the Doomsday Argument has been discussed quite extensively, isn’t the relevant unit not an
individual, but rather an intellectual community? Due to modern communications technology,
there is currently only one intellectual community in the world, but in the past there were many.
There will again be many communities if civilization collapses (without humans going extinct). A
civilization capable of colonizing the galaxy would probably maintain communications, however.
The Doomsday Argument then leads to the conclusion that we are more likely to colonize
the galaxy than one might have otherwise supposed. Clearly, an advocate of the Doomsday
Argument needs to exclude this reference class, but it’s not apparent how this could be justiﬁed.

Another reason to doubt the validity of the Doomsday Argument is that the same reasoning
in slightly diﬀerent contexts leads to conclusions that also seem counterintuitive. Consider the
reverse Doomsday Argument, in which you know your death rank, but are uncertain about your
birth rank. For instance, you may have detected an asteroid on collision course with earth, one
suﬃciently large that it will certainly kill all humans. You then know that you will be among
the last 7 × 109 humans to die. If you accept the logic of the Doomsday Argument, this will
aﬀect your beliefs about how many humans have ever lived. The eﬀect will be even greater if
you know that the point of impact will be on the opposite side of the earth from South Georgia
Island, and you happen at present to be the only person on that remote island. You will then
have good reason to believe that you will be the very last human to die, as the shock wave will
reach you last. According to the Doomsday logic, you should then begin to seriously entertain
various strange notions, such as that the statistics you’d previously believed regarding world
population were actually faked, and that accepted historical and archeological accounts of the
past are incorrect.

Moreover, there is no reason to consider only temporal ranks. Suppose you live in a small

20

village of about 100 people high in the Himalayas. You meet occasional visitors from elsewhere,
from whom you gather that some people live at lower altitudes. They also inform you that your
village is the highest permanent habitation in the world. Due to language diﬃculties, however,
you have obtained no clear idea of the total world population, and think on the basis of these
reports that it might equally well be a few million or a few billion. If you accept the logic of
the Doomsday argument, you should then downgrade the odds of the world population being a
few billion by a factor of a thousand, compared to the possibility that the population is a few
million, on the basis that a world population of a few billion would produce a probability (based
on SSA) of your “altitude rank” being around 100 (as it is) that is a thousand times smaller
than that produced if the world population is a few million.

4.3 More general Doomsday-like arguments

The only real role of birth or other rank in the Doomsday Argument is to provide a deﬁnition
of a set S of observers in the reference class whose size is known (at least approximately), and
which you know you are a member of. If you know that your birth rank is r, then you know
that you are a member of the set of of all observers with birth rank no larger than r, a set
whose size you know to be r. When you condition on your membership in a set S whose size
you known to be r, and apply SSA, your beliefs about the number, N , of observers in the
reference class are modiﬁed from your prior, given by P (N = n). Speciﬁcally, since by SSA,
P (you are in S | N = n) = r/n, you should conclude that

P (N = n| you are in S) =

This parallels the Doomsday Argument of equation (18).

This generalization threatens to produce further counter-intuitive results. Perhaps advocates
of the Doomsday Argument could ﬁnd some rationale for disallowing sets S that are deﬁned with
too close a reference to you (though doing so without also excluding the set of people with birth
rank no greater than yours might be a challenge). If so, you could not conclude on this basis
that humanity will soon go extinct (and may never been very numerous) because your native
language, of which you are the last living speaker, is, has been, and will be the native language
of only a small number of people. Many Doomsday-like conclusions using sets that lack such an
obvious connection to the person making the inference still seem possible, however. Suppose,
for instance, that I have little idea of my birth rank (lacking any knowledge of archeology), but
that I do know that I am among the roughly 109 humans born between the invention of nuclear
weapons and the ﬁrst visit by humans to the moon.
I can apply Doomsday-like logic (with
reference class of all humans) to draw a pessimistic conclusion regarding the total number, N ,
of humans who ever exist. The argument doesn’t tell me whether the humans who do exist were
born before or after I was, but this just increases pessimism with regard to the future.

As another example, suppose that you were convinced that only our solar system contains
In

planets and that some sort of catastrophe is bound to wipe out humanity fairly soon.

particular, you think there will be no more than 1012 humans. However, you consider it plausible
that intelligent beings may exist on Jupiter. Moreover, you believe that if such beings do exist,
they are very numerous compared to humans — Jupiter is much larger than earth, supporting
a very large population at any given time, and reducing the chances that a catastrophe could
wipe out the whole population. Suppose you think that 1016 Jupiter beings will exist if any
such beings exist.
If you now apply SSA with the reference class of all intelligent observers,
and consider the set S of human observers, you will multiply your prior odds in favour of the
existence of Jupiter-beings by the factor 1012/1016 = 1/10000, since if Jupiter-beings exist, the
probability that you would be human rather a Jupiter-being is only 1/10000. Many of the
reasons for disbelieving the ordinary Doomsday Argument apply to arguments of this sort as
well. For example, how intelligent do the Jupiter-beings have to be to count as members of the
reference class?

To me, these arguments seem just as “presumptuous” as the Presumptuous Philosopher’s ar-
gument discussed below in Section 6. Moreover, being based on SSA−SIA, these Doomsday-like
arguments are sensitive to choice of reference class, unlike arguments based on FNC or SSA+SIA
(as discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3). However, arguments of this type are essential if SSA−SIA
is to avoid conﬂict with conclusions by companions, as discussed generally in Section 2.4, and
in connection with the Presumptuous Philosopher problem in Section 6.1.

4.4 The Doomsday Argument with non-human intelligent species

Inclusion of intelligent species other than humans in the reference class changes the focus of the
the Doomsday argument from speciﬁcally human hazards to hazards aﬀecting intelligent species
in general. This is discussed, for example, by Knobe, Olum, and Vilenkin (2006).

Suppose you are sure that many intelligent species exist, have existed, or will exist. Direct
application of the Doomsday Argument with this reference class is then not possible, assuming
you have little idea of your birth rank among all intelligent observers. If you know the distribution
of the total number of individuals in a species who ever exist, there will be no Doomsday eﬀect
— application of SSA should lead you to consider it more likely a priori that your species is
one of the more numerous ones, which cancels the Doomsday eﬀect from knowing that your
birth rank within your species is low. However, a Doomsday eﬀect remains if you are uncertain
about the typical lifetime of intelligent species. For instance, you might be uncertain whether
species that develop advanced technology are likely to use it to destroy themselves (either by
internal conﬂict, or by destruction of their environment), in which case most intelligent species
will be short lived, or whether instead such advanced technology will typically enhance a species’
prospects, in which case most intelligent species will be long lived, with numerous individuals.
Application of SSA together with knowledge that your birth rank within your species is low
then produces a shift of probability toward the hypothesis that most intelligent species are short
lived (most likely including yours, absent any evidence that it is an exception).

4.5 Defusing the Doomsday Argument with SIA or FNC

Assuming SIA as well as SSA defuses the Doomsday Argument. Your original prior for N , given
by probabilities P (N = n), is adjusted by SIA so that the prior probability that N = n becomes
n′=1 n′ P (N = n′). Substituting this expression for occurrences of the form

n P (N = n) / P∞

22

P (N = n) in equation (18) gives the “no doom” probabilities of equation (19).

As one would expect from the discussion in Section 2.3, the same result is obtained if one uses
FNC, with the argument being even more direct. You update your prior for N , with probabilities
P (N = n), by conditioning on the existence of a person with your full set of memories, which
includes knowledge of your birth rank, r. (Your scientiﬁc knowledge regarding what N might
be will have been incorporated into the prior, however, and needn’t be conditioned on at this
point.) However, the (presumably very small) probability that a person exists with birth rank
r and with all your other memories is independent of N , apart from the requirement that N be
at least r. The posterior distribution of N is therefore just the prior for N renormalized to sum
to one over the range from r up — ie, the same as in equation (19).

Similar arguments refute the form of the Doomsday Argument where there are many intelli-
gent species. Assuming SIA makes it more likely that intelligent species are usually long-lived,
cancelling the doomsday eﬀect. If you apply FNC, the probability that someone exists with all
your memories, including your knowledge that your birth rank within your species is r, depends
only on how many intelligent species have at least r individuals, not on how long-lived these
species are beyond that.

The apparent simplicity of these refutations of the Doomsday Argument is deceptive, how-
ever. These refutations will have no force if assuming FNC (or SIA, if you prefer) leads to
insurmountable problems in other contexts. This issue is explored in the next two sections.

5 Freak Observers

Bostrom (2002) argues for SSA on the grounds that without it drawing conclusions from em-
pirical evidence is impossible, due to the existence of “freak observers”. The problem is that
in a large universe, someone will have made every possible observation, regardless of what the
true state of the universe is. So knowing that a particular observation has been made provides
no evidence at all concerning reality. However, if you accept SSA, and know that you made
a particular observation, you can draw useful conclusions, as long as most observations made
by observers in your reference class correspond (at least approximately) to reality. For this to
work, your reference class needn’t be very large — it makes no diﬀerence whether you use all
human-like beings or all intelligent observers, for instance — but it must be at least a bit larger
than the set of observers with exactly your memories, since that narrow reference class might
consist only of observers who have made the same misleading observation.

In arguing for the existence of freak observers, Bostrom mentions possibilities such as brains
in all possible states being emitted from black holes as Hawking radiation, or condensing by
chance from clouds of gas. However, it is perhaps too easy to say that in an inﬁnite universe
such events must happen. The size of the universe that is needed to make such events likely is
quite unimaginably huge, even in comparison with the vastness of the observable universe that we
have by now become accustomed to. It is much easier to imagine misleading observations arising
by more normal mechanisms. Equipment failures, unusual amounts of noise, incompetence, and
fraud are all possible reasons why an apparently deﬁnitive scientiﬁc observation might actually
be wrong. The probability of an observation being wrong will almost always be at least one
in a billion. Since there are quite likely more than a billion planets in the observable universe
that are inhabited by intelligent beings (this is much less than one per galaxy), it is likely that

23

numerous highly misleading observations have been made.

I will argue that you can draw conclusions from observation despite the existence of such
misleading observations without needing SSA — use of FNC being suﬃcient — as long as the
universe is not so large that you would expect there to be other observers with exactly the same
memories as you. According to FNC, you should condition not just on what you know to be the
result of a scientiﬁc observation, but also on all your other memories. The probability that an
observer exists with all your memories, including your memory of the observation, will be much
greater if the observation is correct than if it is incorrect, unless the universe is so large that
it contains many observers whose memories match yours in all respects other than the result
of this observation. You will therefore be justiﬁed in concluding that your observation likely
corresponds to reality.

How big would the universe have to be for the assumption that there are no other observers
whose memories match yours to be false? Though I have not performed any detailed calculations,
it seems to me that the most likely way for another observer with your memories to arise is by
ordinary biological processes on a planet somewhere — not by bizarre mechanisms such as
Hawking radiation. To get a lower limit on the required size of the universe, let us suppose
that life-bearing planets are common, and that biology on them is always much like it is on
earth. Producing a duplicate of you would then require that a species evolve that is nearly
identical to Homo sapiens, and that an individual in this species then acquire the same memories
as you. The human genome contains about 3 × 109 base pairs, for each of which there are
four possible nucleotides. Even supposing that only 1% of these base pairs might diﬀer in a
similar species (others being functionally constrained), and that only 1% of these diﬀerences
would have a noticeable eﬀect, we are left with 43×105
≈ 10180000 possible and distinguishable
human-like individuals. Humans have approximately 1011 neurons. Even supposing that each
neuron and its connections (which typically number in the thousands) encodes only one bit of
useful information, there will be 21011
≈ 1030000000000 possible sets of memories. This number
dominates the number of possible genomes. For comparison, there are roughly 1011 galaxies
in the observable universe, each containing roughly 1011 stars. Even if all these stars have
life-bearing planets, the number of such planets in the observable universe is only 1022.
If
each contained 1010 observers, replaced over 1010 generations, the total number of observers
would be 1042. The universe would therefore need to be a factor of around 1030000000000/1042 =
1029999999958 times larger than the portion of it that we can observe in order for there to be a
good chance that another observer exists with the same memories as you.

Large as it is, 1029999999958 is of course as nothing compared to inﬁnity, which some may believe
describes the actual extent of the universe (eg, Knobe, Olum, and Vilenkin 2006). However,
before insisting that the possibility of a universe this large or inﬁnite should constrain our
reasoning processes, we should ask what else would change if we took this possibility seriously.
Common notions of decisions and ethics would seem to be in serious trouble — if everything is
bound to happen someplace, why strive for a good outcome here? As I argued in Section 2.5,
making fantastic assumptions of this sort carries the danger that subsequent reasoning may
utilize premises that are in fact incompatible with the assumption.

Accordingly, it seems safer to at least initially consider problems of anthropic reasoning on
the assumption of a ﬁnite (and not ridiculously large) universe. However, I do not dismiss the
possibility that the universe is truly inﬁnite in spatial extent, or that an inﬁnity of parallel

24

universes exist, due perhaps to the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics being
correct. But if so, and if the consequences are as they might superﬁcially seem, then the
arguments concerning the puzzles of anthropic reasoning that I address here need to go beyond
what has appeared in the literature so far. Great care would need to be taken to ensure that
assumptions based on ideas such as uniqueness of individuals do not enter in subtle ways. I will
consider inﬁnite universes in Section 7, but for the moment, I conﬁne myself to arguments that
are compatible with a more common sense view of the universe.

6 Presumptuous Philosophers

The Presumptuous Philosopher problem has been interpreted (eg, by Bostrom (2002)) as showing
that SIA should not be accepted, because it leads to an unreasonable preference for cosmological
theories that imply that the number of observers in the universe is large. If theory A implies
that the number of observers (in the chosen reference class) is a trillion times larger than that
implied by theory B, SIA says that you should shift your relative prior beliefs in theories A and
B by a factor of a trillion. If you judge the two theories equally likely on other grounds (and
there are no other plausible theories), application of SIA should leave you virtually certain that
theory A is true — so certain that you would rationally ignore almost any future evidence to
the contrary. Such dogmatism seems intuitively unacceptable.

FNC also seems vulnerable to the Presumptuous Philosopher problem. The probability of an
observer with exactly your memories existing somewhere in the universe will be greater if the
number of observers who “might have” your memories is larger. If your memories are detailed
enough to make the probability of their occurring small even in the largest universe considered,
the probability that an observer with your memories exists will be directly proportional to the
number of observers, producing the same shift as for SIA.

As an extreme, a theory that says the universe is inﬁnite would appear to be inﬁnitely favoured
by SIA. FNC would also favour such a theory over one in which the universe is only a few billion
light years in extent, though with FNC the preference for an inﬁnite universe would only be
very large, not inﬁnite (since once the universe is large enough that it is nearly certain that
at least one observer with your memories will exist somewhere, sometime, further increases in
the size of the universe are neither favoured or disfavoured). Here, however, I will discuss the
Presumptuous Philosopher problem under the assumption that the universe is ﬁnite, and though
it may be very large, it is not so large that exact duplicates of observers are likely to occur. I
consider ﬁrst the consequences of SSA−SIA versus those of SSA+SIA for theories that diﬀer
in the density of observers, but not in the size of the universe. I then consider what FNC says
in this situation. Finally, I discuss the more diﬃcult problem of assessing theories that predict
universes of diﬀerent sizes.

6.1 Theories diﬀering in the density of observers — SSA−SIA vs. SSA+SIA
Implicit in the simple statement of the Presumptuous Philosopher problem is the assumption
that the details of why theory A predicts many more observers than theory B do not matter. In
particular, Bostrom and ´Cirkovi´c (2003) present two versions of the Presumptuous Philosopher
problem, one in which theories A and B diﬀer with respect to the size of the universe, the other
in which they diﬀer with respect to the density of observers, and consider (without discussing

25

the matter) that the same conclusion (that SIA gives wrong results) should be reached in both
situations. On the contrary, I will argue here that if theories A and B agree on the size of the
universe (which both also predict is homogeneous), but diﬀer in that theory A predicts a higher
density of observers, then the preference given by SIA to theory A may be well justiﬁed.

Throughout this section and the next, I will assume that intelligent observers in diﬀerent
star systems cannot aﬀect each other — not through travel, communication, or detection, nor
though any non-deliberate means — since any contact with observers in other star systems would
provide direct evidence of the density of observers, invalidating the discussion. It is important
to keep in mind that this assumption is false. Section 7.1 discusses what we may conclude about
the density of observers given what we actually know. The discussion below is meant to clarify
the philosophical issues involved in a simple empirical context, which does not correspond to
our actual state of knowledge.

Leslie (1996) and Olum (2002) discuss a historical instance of theories diﬀering with regard
to the density of observers, in which Olum argues in favour of the predictions of SIA, whereas
Leslie, and also Bostrom and ´Cirkovi´c (2003), argue against SIA. Marochnik (1983) advanced
a theory that earth-like planets can form only around stars whose distance from the galactic
centre leads them to revolve around the galactic centre at a speed that nearly maintains their
position relative to the density waves deﬁning the galaxy’s spiral arms. This theory limits the
possible locations of earth-like planets to a small region, occupying a fraction f of the galaxy,
with f perhaps being in the range 0.01 to 0.1. Given various other assumptions (eg, that life
formed in this region does not colonize the rest of the galaxy), Marochnik’s theory would imply
that there are a fraction f fewer intelligent observers in the universe than would be expected
under an alternative “planets everywhere” theory, in which there is no such restriction on where
an earth-like planet can form.

As Olum notes, Marochnik’s theory is therefore disfavoured by SIA — ie, if you accept SIA,
you should reduce the probability you assign to this theory below the probability you would have
assigned to it based on ordinary considerations. In particular, if you thought the two theories
equally likely excluding consideration of SIA, and no other theories are plausible, you would
consider Marochnik’s theory to have probability f /(1+f ) after applying SIA (equivalently, the
odds in favour of Marochnik’s theory shift from 1 to f ). In contrast, to someone who accepts SSA
but not SIA, and who does not know the distance of any earth-like planet from the galactic centre,
Marochnik’s theory is neither favoured nor disfavoured compared to the “planets everywhere”
theory, provided that the regions where life is possible according to Marochnik’s theory are large
enough that intelligent observers are nearly certain to have arisen in some such region at least
once in the history of the universe. (f would need to be very small, less than about 10−20, for
this condition to be false.)

Suppose now that we are able to measure the distance of the sun from the galactic centre,
and we ﬁnd that this distance is such that it leads to the sun nearly maintaining its position
with respect to the galaxy’s spiral arms, as predicted by Marochnik’s theory. In fact, according
to Marochnik’s (1983) paper (though perhaps not more recent measurements), our sun does
appear to be at the required distance. We could easily imagine this was not known until later,
however. Should such an observation be taken as a conﬁrmation of Marochnik’s theory?

According to all views of the matter, this observation does indeed increase the probability
that Marochnik’s theory is correct. In particular, the odds in favour of Marochnik’s theory are

26

multiplied by the ratio of the probabilities of this observation under Marochnik’s theory and
the “planets everywhere” theory, which is 1/f (since the probability of observing this is 1 for
Marochnik’s theory and f for the “planets everywhere” theory). However, if SIA is accepted,
this increase in the probability of Marochnik’s theory merely cancels the previous lowering of
the theory’s probability due to its prediction that there are relatively few intelligent observers.
(Equivalently, the odds in favour of Marochnik’s theory shift from f to f × (1/f ) = 1.) The
result is that Marochnik’s theory, after such a observation is made, has the same probability as
it would have had without any such observation, and without adjusting its prior probability by
applying SIA. In contrast, someone who accepts SSA but not SIA, and who on the basis of prior
information regards Marochnik’s theory and the“ planets everywhere” theory as equally likely,
would take the observation that our sun is in the small region of the galaxy where Marochnik’s
theory predicts stars with earth-like planets are possible as reason to increase the probability of
Marochnik’s theory to 1/(1+f ) (ie, the odds in favour of Marochnik’s theory would be 1/f ). This
preference comes about because under SSA (with a reference class of all intelligent observers) it
is unlikely that we would be in this special place in the galaxy if intelligent observers are found
throughout the galaxy, but it is certain that we will be in this special place if it is the only place
where intelligent observers can exist.

The device of imagining “companion” observers can be used to shed light on which of these
views is correct. Suppose that in addition to any intelligent observers who may originate on
planets, intelligent observers taking the form of complex patterns of plasma and magnetic ﬁelds
exist in the atmospheres of all stars. Initially, let us assume that each star harbours only around
a dozen such star-beings (and we know this). Such star-beings therefore make up a negligible
fraction of the reference class of all intelligent observers, even if a planet holding billions of
intelligent beings is found around only one star in a million. The star-beings living in our
sun’s atmosphere are quite willing to engage in astrophysical discussions, once we realize they
are there. After these discussions they have the same observational data as we do. Will their
conclusions about Marochnik’s theory agree with ours? The answer depends on the principles
by which inference is done, as discussed below, and summarized in the tables on the next page.

Consider ﬁrst what conclusions will be drawn if humans (or other planet-beings) use as their
reference class for SSA or SIA only other planet-beings (not star beings), and similarly star-
beings use as their reference reference class only other star-beings. Since the two theories under
consideration make the same predictions regarding star-beings, SSA and SIA will then have no
eﬀect on inferences by star-beings, but may have an eﬀect on inferences by planet-beings. (These
conclusions are shown on the left side of the top table.)

Suppose ﬁrst that neither we nor the star-beings in our sun’s atmosphere know the position of
the sun in the galaxy. The star-beings will then take our existence on earth as evidence against
Marochnik’s theory, since according to that theory, earth-like planets occur only in a special
region of the galaxy, and (like us) the star-beings have no reason to think that the sun is in
this special region. If they thought Marochnik’s theory and the “planets everywhere” theory
were equally likely before knowing that humans exist, they will think Marochnik’s theory has
probability f /(1+f ) after (ie, the odds in favour of Marochnik’s theory will be f ).

Suppose now that the distance of the sun from the galactic centre is measured, and found to be
such that the sun nearly maintains its position with respect to the spiral arms. The star-beings
will now no longer take our existence on earth as evidence against Marochnik’s theory, since given

Inferences by planet-beings and star-beings under various assumptions. The upper table is for
the scenario in which star-beings are much less numerous than planet-beings, the lower table
when star-beings are much more numerous than planet-beings. Entries in the tables are the
odds, utilizing the information listed on the left for that row and the rows above, in favour of
Marocknik’s theory versus the “planets everywhere” theory, with f being the fraction of stars
in the location where Marochnik’s theory says earth-like planets are possible.

28

that the sun is in this special place, it is not surprising that it has an earth-like planet. However,
Marochnik’s theory is not made any more probable than the “planets everywhere” theory by
this observation. As discussed above, after ﬁnding that humans exist, the star-beings’ odds for
Marochnik’s theory being true would be f . The probabilities for the subsequent observation that
the sun is in the special position required by Marochnik’s theory are 1 if Marochnik’s theory is
true, and f if the “planets everywhere” theory is true. The odds for Marochnik’s theory shift
by the ratio of these probabilities, leaving the odds at f × (1/f ) = 1.

To see why it is reasonable that the star-beings would not favour Marochnik’s theory in this
situation, consider for comparison how you would evaluate a theory that a certain ﬁsh occurs
only in acidic lakes, versus the contrary theory that it occurs in all lakes. The observation that
this ﬁsh is present in a nearby acidic lake tells you nothing about which of these theories is true
— you need to look in a non-acidic lake to obtain any relevant data.6

The conclusions of the star-beings regarding Marochnik’s theory are the same as we would
reach by applying SIA. I will call these the “non-anthropic” conclusions, since they are also what
one would obtain by ignoring both SSA and SIA, as some observer outside the universe would
do (just as with the ﬁsh example above).

Before considering this reasoning by companion star-beings as supporting the non-anthropic
conclusions, however, we should consider that the star-beings might apply SSA and/or SIA with
the reference class of all intelligent observers, including both us and them. (The resulting con-
clusions are shown on the right of the top table.) If the star-beings accept SIA, they will adjust
their prior to disfavour Marochnik’s theory, since it predicts many fewer intelligent observers,
thereby reducing the odds in favour of Marochnik’s theory to approximately f . (Recall here
that the star-beings form a negligible fraction of all intelligent observers.) However, if they now
apply SSA in conjunction with their observation that they are star-beings, this eﬀect is undone,
since the more planet-based intelligent observers there are, the smaller the odds that one is a
star-being. (Recall that the number of star-beings is the same for both theories). The odds in
favour of Marochnik’s theory therefore shift by the factor 1/f , to f × (1/f ) = 1. Subsequent
reasoning proceeds to the non-anthropic conclusions just as above — the observation of humans
on earth decreases the probability of Marochnik’s theory (the odds in favour decline to f ), and
the subsequent measurement showing that the sun is in the special place where earth-like plan-
ets are possible restores this probability to its original value, but no higher (ie, at this point,
Marochnik’s theory is neither favoured nor disfavoured).

On the other hand, if the star-beings accept SSA but not SIA, and use the reference class
of all intelligent beings, their conclusions will match those of humans who also accept SSA but
not SIA (with the same reference class). A doomsday-style eﬀect occurs, of the sort discussed

6There may be a curious order dependence of intuitions here. If you ﬁrst ﬁnd that this lake is acidic, and
then ﬁnd that it contains this ﬁsh, you will certainly reason as above. But if you ﬁrst discover that the lake
contains this ﬁsh, and only later ﬁnd that the lake is acidic, you might be tempted to take this observation as
conﬁrmation that the ﬁsh is found only in acidic lakes, particularly if acidic lakes are rare. The diﬀerence appears
to derive from a heuristic for avoiding self-deception — predicting that the lake is acidic after ﬁnding the ﬁsh
in it is psychologically risky, in that you might be wrong. So if you actually make such a prediction, your prior
probability that the ﬁsh is found only in acidic lakes must really be high. In contrast, no such stark confrontation
with reality occurs when you know the lake is acidic before looking for the ﬁsh (which is therefore likely to be
found regardless of which theory is correct). It might then be easier to deceive yourself regarding your true prior
beliefs. So, taking into account your own capacity for self-deception, your conclusion may depend on the order of
observations. Here, however, I assume that we are not prone to self-deception of this sort.

29

in Section 4.3, in which the star-beings initially adjust the probability of Marochnik’s theory
upwards, since this theory makes it more likely that one is a star-being, like them, rather than
a planet-being. Observation of humans on earth causes the probability of Marochnik’s theory
to go down again (since it says that earth-like planets are rare). Finding that the sun is in
the special place where Marochnik’s theory says earth-like planets are possible then raises the
probability of Marochnik’s theory back up again, to the point where it is favoured by the factor
1/f over the “planets everywhere” theory.

This consideration of companion star-beings therefore does not deﬁnitively refute the method-
ology of accepting SSA but not SIA — provided humans and star-beings both use SSA−SIA
with the reference class of all intelligent beings, their conclusions are the same. This is expected
from the (only slightly diﬀerent) general discussion in Section 4.3.

However, this consideration of companions does undermine the claim that the Presumptuous
Philosopher problem makes SIA implausible (at least on the basis of this scenario). To review,
the claim is that although SIA defuses the counter-intuitive Doomsday Argument, it does so at
the cost of producing an equally counter-intuitive Presumptuous Philosopher eﬀect. Here, how-
ever, we see that the conclusion of the Presumptuous Philosopher in this scenario is implausible
only if you accept arguments of the Doomsday type — such as would lead the star-beings to
favour Marochnik’s theory prior to any observations solely on the basis that it makes it more
probable that an observer will be a star-being like themselves. An advocate of SIA who rejects
Doomsday-type arguments will therefore be untroubled by this instance of the Presumptuous
Philosopher problem.

We might alternatively suppose that, rather than each star having only a dozen star-beings,
each star instead has trillions of them, so they are vastly more numerous than planet-based
beings, under any theory. (Conclusions on this assumption are shown in the bottom table.)
In this situation, anthropic reasoning has no eﬀect on the conclusions of the star-beings, who
will reach the non-anthropic conclusions regardless of whether they accept SSA and/or SIA,
using any plausible reference class. SIA also has no eﬀect for human observers in this situation,
provided that they use the reference class of all intelligent observers (not all humans, or all
planet-based observers). However, SSA has the eﬀect, for humans, of decreasing the probability
of Marochnik’s theory, since under this theory, one is less likely to be a planet-based being than
one is under the “planets everywhere” theory. This decrease is undone once the sun is found to
be in the special place where planets are possible under Marochnik’s theory. The results match
the non-anthropic conclusions of the star-beings, once they know of the existence of humans, so
this scenario does not resolve any issues. However, if the humans used the reference class of all
planet-based intelligent observers (excluding star-beings), their conclusions using SSA−SIA will
not match those reached by the star-beings.

Here again, SSA−SIA can produce conclusions consistent with those of companion observers
provided a reference class including both is used. Notice, however, that the conclusions found
using SSA−SIA in this scenario with numerous companions are diﬀerent from those found when
the companions were less numerous. Applying anthropic reasoning based on SSA−SIA leads
to conclusions regarding planet-based observers that depend on how many non-planet-based
observers exist, even though this information would appear to be irrelevant.

In another scenario, we might have two theories, one of which says that intelligent observers
are common, whereas the other says that they are randomly distributed at a low density (but

30

high enough that it is likely that at least one intelligent species does exist). In contrast with
Marochnik’s theory, in this scenario there is no possibility of discovering that the sun is in a
special life-bearing region. Using SSA−SIA, the prior probabilities for the two theories depend
only on normal considerations of plausibility, and our observation that we exist does not change
these probabilities. Using SSA+SIA, the prior probabilities are adjusted in favour of the theory
that intelligent observers are common, and these probabilities are again unchanged by the ob-
servation that we exist. Consideration of star-beings as possible companion observers produces
results analogous to those discussed above for Marochnik’s theory — consistency requires that
the reference class include all intelligent observers, and the conclusions using SSA−SIA, but not
SSA+SIA, depend on the number of companion observers.

In summary, consideration of companion observers provides strong evidence that in scenar-
ios where the density of observers varies, the conclusions found using SSA+SIA are correct,
whereas those found using SSA−SIA are not. Certainly, the conclusions of SSA−SIA regarding
Marochnik’s theory seem quite acceptable. Lingering unease may remain, however, when the
shift in prior odds produced by SIA is not the factor of 10 to 100 that occurs with Marochnik’s
theory, but rather a factor of a trillion or more, which one can imagine could occur with some
other theory. I will consider such cases of extreme “presumption” below, when discussing FNC,
which I see as the more principled, even if largely equivalent, alternative to SSA+SIA.

6.2 Theories diﬀering in the density of observers — result of applying FNC

To apply FNC, you multiply your prior odds for one theory over another, based on ordinary
scientiﬁc evidence, by the ratio of the probabilities that these theories give for someone to exist
with your exact memories (excluding your scientiﬁc knowledge that contributed to the original
prior odds, but including any additional scientiﬁc observations). As discussed in Section 2.3, the
results of applying FNC are much the same as those of applying SSA+SIA. Thinking in terms
of FNC avoids the need to specify any reference class of observers, however, and clariﬁes the
issues that are involved in this type of reasoning.

Here is a superﬁcial analysis of how FNC applies to Marochnik’s theory versus the “planets
everywhere” theory, which was discussed in Section 6.1 using SSA−SIA and SSA+SIA. If a total
of C earth-like planets exist according to the “planets everywhere” theory, and each has some
very small probability, ǫ, of producing someone with your exact memories, then the probability
of your existing according to the “planets everywhere” theory is ǫC (assuming, as I am, that this
is much less than one). According to Marochnik’s theory, the number of earth-like planets will
be smaller by the factor f , and hence the probability that you exist will be only ǫf C. Assuming
equal prior probabilities for the two theories, your odds in favour of Marochnik’s theory should
be f , if this is all you know. Suppose you then make a reliable observation that the sun is in
the special region where, according to Marochnik’s theory, earth-like planets can form. Your
odds in favour of Marochnik’s theory should then change to 1 (ie, the two theories should
become equally likely), since the chance that someone exists with your memories — including
your memory of observing that the sun is in this region — is the same for both theories. The
extra earth-like planets that exist according to the “planets everywhere” theory do not increase
the probability that you will exist, since a being on a planet outside the special region is very
unlikely to remember having observed that they are in the special region, and also have your
other memories. (See Section 5 for consideration of the possibility of false observations.) These

31

conclusions are the same as those found in Section 6.1 using SSA+SIA.

Although I believe that this superﬁcial analysis produces the correct result, it conceals a
number of subtleties. One is that, contrary to what is implicitly assumed in the argument above,
earth-like planets in other galaxies could not really produce someone having your memories,
assuming that you have seen the numerous photos of distant galaxies that most people have
seen. From a planet in a diﬀerent galaxy, these galaxies would be viewed from a diﬀerent angle,
be much larger or smaller, or be obscured. (As discussed earlier, I assume for the moment that
the universe is not so large that one would expect to ﬁnd another galaxy whose views of other
galaxies are just by chance virtually identical to ours.) Because of this, it is actually essential
to the argument that Marochnik’s theory applies not just to most galaxies, but to our galaxy
in particular.
If our galaxy were a rare exception in which earth-like planets were possible
everywhere even according to Marochnik’s theory (and you knew this), applying FNC would
not change the probabilities of the two theories, since the probability that you would exist in
our galaxy (where you clearly are) would be the same for both theories. Careful application
of SSA+SIA would also lead to this conclusion, but only because the shift in odds away from
Marochnik’s theory that is produced by SIA is cancelled by applying SSA, taking account of
the greater probability of being in an exceptional galaxy if the other galaxies are less populated.
This seems to me to be a rather perverse way of reasoning to the correct conclusion, however.

Furthermore, it is questionable whether a planet in a distant part of our galaxy — likely
diﬀering from earth in elemental abundances (as determined by local supernovae), in the local
density of stars, in cosmic ray intensities, and in the view of the Milky Way in the night sky
— would have even a tiny chance of producing life that evolves in just the way it has on earth,
and of then producing an individual with your memories. As an analogy, suppose you are
given detailed photographs of a house, which you are told is either in India or in Canada, and
are asked to guess in which of these countries the house is located. If you are knowledgeable
about architectural styles and construction practices in the two countries, it is quite likely that
you would be able to tell which country the house is located in. Of course, someone with less
knowledge might not be able to tell where the house is located. Similarly, someone with suﬃcient
knowledge of our galaxy would likely be able to tell where in our galaxy earth is located, without
the need for any explicit measurement of location. However, if you lack suﬃcient knowledge,
you will not know where in the galaxy earth is located without an explicit measurement, and
so, as far as you know, any earth-like planet in the galaxy might have produced someone with
your memories, and the more such earth-like planets there are, the greater the chance that you
will exist. Put another way, the narrow region where earth-like planets are possible according
to Marochnik’s theory leads to a restricted range of possible characteristics of these planets
and their inhabitants. Since you do not know what this range is, you do not know whether or
not the characteristics of earth and humanity are included. The possibility that they are not
reduces the chance of your existing if Marochnik’s theory is true. As this example makes clear,
the probabilities used in FNC may reﬂect your ignorance, rather than the operation of some
random physical process.

When applying FNC, it is clear that some “presumptuous” conclusions that may appear
to follow from SIA are not actually problematic. Consider, for example, the theory that all
bacteria are intelligent beings. You may regard this theory as unlikely, and assign it a low prior
probability. However, there are approximately 1021 times as many bacteria as humans on earth
(Whitman, Coleman, and Wiebe 1998). Similar ratios for analogous organisms presumably

32

hold on other earth-like planets. According to SIA, we should therefore increase the prior
odds that bacteria are intelligent by a factor of 1021, which may well make the theory highly
probable despite its prior implausibility. However, if you apply FNC rather than SSA+SIA,
the probability of this theory will not be increased — whether bacteria are intelligent or not
has no eﬀect on the probability that you will exist with all your memories, since you are not
a bacterium. One does in fact reach this same conclusion in the end using SSA+SIA, since
the huge increase in the theory’s probability from applying SIA is cancelled by an equally huge
decrease from the low probability of an intelligent observer being human if the theory is true. As
was the case above, however, such reasoning based on SSA+SIA seems rather contorted, even
if the right answer is obtained, compared to the straightforward application of FNC. Note also
that according to SSA−SIA, you should decrease your (presumably already low) odds in favour
of bacteria being intelligent by a factor of 1021, on the grounds that if they were intelligent, you
would likely be a bacterium. In this scenario it is SSA−SIA, not SSA+SIA or FNC, that could
be accused of presumption.

Scenarios more troubling for an advocate of FNC can be imagined, however. Suppose you
have calculated that the number of earth-like planets in the galaxy is about one thousand, on
the basis of what you believe to be the correct mechanism of planet formation, and assuming
that Newton’s theory of gravity is an adequate approximation. It occurs to you that perhaps
Einstein’s theory of gravity would give diﬀerent results. You think the chances of this are only
about 9% (odds of about 1/10), since Newton’s theory is usually a good approximation, but
you decide nevertheless to redo the calculation using Einstein’s more accurate theory. This new
calculation says that the number of earth-like planets in the galaxy is about one billion — a
million times more than found with the Newtonian calculation. You judge that mistakes in such
calculations happen about 10% of the time (at least without further checking, which you haven’t
done yet), so the probability of getting a divergent result such as you obtained if Newton’s theory
is actually an adequate approximation is 10% (since a mistake would need to be made), whereas
the probability of a divergent result if Newton’s theory is not adequate is about one (since a
correct result would diﬀer, and an error would also be fairly likely to produce a diﬀerent result).
Using ordinary reasoning, the result of this calculation should therefore lead you to multiply by
10 the original odds in favour of the Newtonian calculation being wrong, which produces odds
of about 1. So at this point, you would consider that the number of earth-like planets in the
galaxy is equally likely to be one thousand or one billion.

However, if you now apply FNC (or SIA), you will increase the odds in favour of the Newtonian
calculation being wrong by a factor of a million, since the calculation using Einstein’s theory leads
to a factor of a million more earth-like planets, with a corresponding increase in the probability of
someone with your memories existing. This extreme certainty seems presumptuous, particularly
when you haven’t even checked your calculation yet.

A hint at resolving this problem comes from considering a scenario that is similar except that
the calculations are not of the number of earth-like planets, but rather of a numerical quantity
that has been precisely measured by experiment.
If your calculation using Einstein’s theory
produces a very good ﬁt to the experimental data, you might indeed be highly conﬁdent that it
is correct, even before checking it. When calculating the number of earth-like planets, however,
no precise target number is matched — FNC and SIA just say that bigger is better, up to
whatever limit is imposed by other observations.

33

Accordingly, even if you accept that the number of earth-like planets with human-like ob-
servers must be large, there is no necessity that this number be large for this particular reason.
There may be many ways that the probability of your existing could be increased other than by
increasing the number of earth-like planets — for instance, by a higher chance of life developing
on each planet, or a higher chance that once life develops it produces an intelligent species. If
there were no upper limit, FNC or SIA would just favour all of these, but if there is a limit on
the density of intelligent observers, only a limited number of these factors can strongly favour
more human-like observers, reducing the probability that any one of them in particular does.

At this point, recall the assumption stated at the beginning of Section 6.1 — that intelligent
observers in diﬀerent star systems have no eﬀect on each other.
If this is true, we can have
no bound from observation on the density of intelligent observers, and the considerations just
discussed will not reduce the excessive certainty of the conclusions from FNC and SIA. However,
if there is a limit on the density of observers, FNC (and SIA) need not produce unreasonably
certain belief in particular theories, such as that the hypothetical Newtonian calculation above
is wrong. We in fact know that intelligent species may possibly interact. The implications of
this are discussed in detail in Section 7.1, and show that the actual eﬀects of FNC are not what
what one would think from a simplistic consideration of the Presumptuous Philosopher problem.

6.3 Theories diﬀering in the size of the universe

I will now consider the eﬀect that FNC has on the probabilities of theories that diﬀer in the
size of universe that they predict. The eﬀects of applying SSA+SIA are similar, but I will omit
the details of this here. As above, I will assume that all theories predict a universe of a ﬁnite
size, which moreover is not so large that you would expect another observer with exactly your
memories to exist. I will also assume that all theories predict a homogeneous universe, in which
intelligent observers arise with some density. In practice, diﬀerent theories might well predict
both diﬀerent sizes of the universe and diﬀerent densities of observers, but for simplicity, I will
assume here that all theories predict the same density, so that the total number of observers is
simply proportional to the size of the universe.

With these assumptions, a Presumptuous Philosopher eﬀect can easily arise. Suppose theory
A says that the universe contains 1024 galaxies, whereas theory B says that it contains only
1012 galaxies. If these theories appear equally likely on ordinary grounds, application of FNC
will lead you to consider theory A to be a trillion times more likely than theory B, since it is a
trillion times more likely that someone with your memories will exist somewhere if theory A is
true.7 Note that this implication of FNC holds regardless of any details of where and how often
human-like or other intelligent observers might or might not arise — as long as these details are
the same for both theories, the theory producing a bigger universe will also produce a greater
probability that a being with your memories exists, in direct proportion.8

This factor of a trillion preference for theory A seems unreasonable to most people. FNC will

7Here “somewhere” could be anywhere in the universe. In Section 6.2, where the large-scale features of the
universe could be considered ﬁxed (since the theories did not diﬀer in this regard), I pointed out that someone
with your memories could exist only in our galaxy. This is not true in this context, where a galactic neighborhood
matching what we see is more likely to exist if the universe is large than if it is small.

8Theories in which the universe changes more slowly, and so stays longer in something resembling the state
you currently observe, might also be favoured. I will not elaborate on this possibility, however, but merely assume
that the universe evolves at the same rate in all theories.

34

produce even greater degrees of certainty in favour of theories predicting even bigger universes,
up to odds of 1030000000000 or more, before the assumption of no duplicate observers breaks down
(see Section 5). Unlike the situation with theories diﬀering in the density of observers, there
seems to be no plausible story involving companion observers that would provide any support for
this result of FNC — if the star-being companions of Section 6.1 employ FNC in this situation,
they will come to the same extreme conclusion, but will also be subject to the same intuition
that this is unreasonable.

Olum (2002) oﬀers a way of avoiding the extreme preference for larger universes produced by
FNC (or in his case, SIA) — reduce the prior probability of theories in proportion to the size of
universe they predict. In the example above, if we assign theory A a prior probability a trillion
times less than that assigned to theory B, then after the multiplication by a factor of a trillion
that comes from applying FNC, the ﬁnal odds in favour of theory A will be 1 (ie, A and B will
be considered equally likely). This seems rather contrived, but it does raise a crucial question
— how should prior probabilities for cosmological theories be assigned?

For many theories, we can assign well-justiﬁed prior probabilities based on a wealth of back-
ground knowledge. Consider, for example, theories regarding where eels spawn. We can assess
their prior plausibility using our knowledge of the behaviour of other ﬁsh, as well as our knowl-
edge of related matters, such as ocean currents. In other situations, our prior beliefs will have
a less detailed basis, but will at least incorporate various common-sense constraints. The back-
ground knowledge we use to set priors will itself be based partly on deeper prior beliefs. If we
could trace the origins of our beliefs back far enough, we would presumably ﬁnd some genetically-
determined prior biases, that result from natural selection. When assessing theories of biology,
geology, macroscopic physics, or other earth-bound phenomena, knowing that our prior beliefs
have this ultimate origin is reassuring — it gives us some reason to think these prior biases are
well founded.

It is diﬃcult to see, however, why natural selection should have provided us with genetically-
determined biases suitable for assigning prior probabilities to cosmological theories. Suppose,
for example, that the crucial diﬀerence between theories A and B above is that A says space is
ﬂat, with the topology of a torus, whereas B says space is positively curved, with the topology of
a sphere. (Assume that for some theoretical reason not in dispute, the torus must have a trillion
times the volume of the sphere.) Canceling the eﬀect of FNC by deciding that the spherical
universe should have prior probability a trillion times greater than the toroidal universe seems
quite arbitrary, but deciding that they should have equal prior probabilities is really just as
arbitrary. We simply have no basis for any prior beliefs regarding the topology of the universe.

A further diﬃculty is that we have no ﬁrm basis for excluding “extraneous” multiple universes.
Suppose the advocates of theory B above modify it to produce theory B ∗, which is just like
B, except that rather than postulating the existence of only the single universe we observe, it
claims that there are a trillion similar universes, which diﬀer only in the actual results of random
physical processes.9 The probability of someone with your memories existing in any of these
universes is now the same as for theory A. This maneuver may appear unaesthetic, at least if
these trillion universes have no possibility of interacting, but compared to the previous situation

9Of course, this will not work if theory B is deterministic, but there will likely be “pseudo-random” aspects of
any theory, sensitive to slight changes in parameters or initial conditions, that would again allow for a multiplicity
of similar, but not identical, universes.

35

with odds of a trillion against theory B, lack of elegance is a minor problem.

Is rationally assigning prior probabilities to cosmological theories simply impossible? Perhaps
not entirely. Sometimes, the theories being compared all assume the same fundamental physical
laws, but represent diﬀerent calculations of the consequences of these laws. Two theories of
galaxy formation, for example, are likely to assume the same laws for gravitation and other
forces, and may also assume the same initial conditions from the big bang. If so, the theories
can be seen a making diﬀerent approximations to a single mathematical result, whose exact
computation is infeasible. We have some experience with mathematical approximations, and so
have some basis for assigning prior probabilities to which (if any) of these theories is correct.

Because of the lack of clarity surrounding these issues, I see no clear grounds for rejecting
FNC or SIA on the basis of their supposedly counterintuitive consequences regarding theories
with diﬀerently-sized universes. Greater clarity might be obtained by considering examples of
actual cosmological theories that predict universes of diﬀerent (ﬁnite) sizes, but I am not aware
of any such examples. Most current cosmological theories favour a universe, or universes, of
inﬁnite size, as I discuss below in Section 7.2.

7 Anthropic arguments in cosmology

I conclude by applying FNC to some interesting problems in cosmology, some of which will also
help further clarify the general issues involving FNC, SSA, and SIA.

7.1 How densely do intelligent species occur?

I start with what can be seen as a continuation of the discussion regarding the density of
observers in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, except that I will now apply FNC in conjunction with our
actual empirical knowledge, which does not correspond to the earlier assumption that there is
no possibility of intelligent species interacting.

Our knowledge of astronomy and technology leads us to believe that if intelligent extraterres-
trials exist, it would probably not be tremendously diﬃcult for them, or at least their robotic
probes, to visit earth. (We ourselves are likely to have this capability within at most a few
hundred years, unless our technological civilization collapses.) Interstellar travel is likely to be
costly, of course, and will certainly require patience, due to the speed of light limit. Many
extraterrestrials may decide not to undertake such exploration. But if a large number of ex-
traterrestrial species exist, it seems certain that at least a fair number will explore neighboring
stars. Sometimes exploration will be followed by colonization, producing a sphere of habitation
that expands at perhaps 1% of the speed of light. In this manner, a single species could reach
most of the galaxy in around 10 million years, which is a small fraction of the galaxy’s age.

Radio communication with extraterrestrial civilizations is much easier than travel, and is well

within our current capabilities (at least if transmissions are directed at a particular star).

Despite this, we do not currently observe any extraterrestrials, nor do we see any evidence
that they have been in our vicinity in the past.10 This conﬂict with expectations has been called
“Fermi’s Paradox”, and has prompted many attempts at explanation, summarized in a review

10Readers who believe they have observed extraterrestrials may of course apply FNC themselves, and reach

diﬀerent conclusions than I do here.

36

by Brin (1983). The paradox seems even more severe if you consider FNC (or SIA) to be a
correct principle of inference, since it seems there would then be a further bias in favour of a
high density of intelligent extraterrestrial species (of the sort who “might have” produced an
observer with your memories).

The application of FNC to this problem is actually more subtle, however. For someone with
your memories to exist, it is necessary not only for a suitable planet to exist, but also for the
subsequent evolution of an intelligent species on that planet to proceed without disturbance
by other intelligent species. Once someone like you is produced, they must remain unaware of
contact with any other intelligent species. There is therefore a tradeoﬀ. If earth-like planets are
common, if life arises easily on each planet, if intelligence species are likely to evolve, and to
develop a technological civilization, the existence of someone with your memories will be more
likely, provided there is no interference by some other intelligent species. But these same factors
increase the probability that such an interfering species will exist.

A realistic analysis of this situation would be complex, as can be seen from earlier related
work on interstellar colonization, such as that of Hanson (1998). I will consider only a fairly
simple and abstract model intended to show the general nature of the tradeoﬀ described above.
This model has three components.

First, suppose that the mechanisms of galaxy formation are known, and that the pattern of
stars in our galaxy is beyond the inﬂuence of intelligent life. Someone with your memories, which
include your memory of the night sky, can then only have arisen on a planet of our sun, at the
current time. Suppose, however, that we have various theories regarding planet formation, the
origin of life, the evolution of intelligence, and the development of technological civilization. Any
particular combination of theories will produce some (tiny) probability, p, that an individual with
your memories will arise, assuming that this development is not interfered with by a species from
elsewhere. Note that you don’t know p, since you don’t know which theories are true, though
you have prior probabilities for them based on ordinary scientiﬁc knowledge.

Second, suppose the probability that an intelligent species with our level of science and tech-
nology will arise in a region of size dw around spacetime point w is p M (w) dw, where M (w) is
a known function giving the relative densities of intelligent species originating at diﬀerent times
and places. M (w) will be zero outside of galaxies, and at times too early for life to have devel-
oped. Making the probability of such an intelligent species arising elsewhere be proportional to
p incorporates the assumption that the unknown factors that inﬂuence the probability of your
existence are the same as those that inﬂuence the probability of other intelligent species arising.

Third, suppose there is a known function, A(w), and an unknown factor, f , such that f A(w)
is the probability that a species arising at spacetime location w will destroy the possibility of
someone with your memories existing — either by colonizing earth and thereby preventing the
development of humans, or by simply making its existence known to you before the present
time, contrary to your actual memories. Assuming inﬂuences are limited by the speed of light,
A(w) will be zero if w is outside your past light-cone. The factor f will depend on how stable
technological civilizations are, how easy interstellar travel is, and how often intelligent species
are motivated to communicate, explore, and colonize. Assume you have prior distributions for
these factors, and hence also for f .

We can now write the expected number of other species that interfere with your existence as

37

follows:

Z f A(w) p M (w) dw = f p Z A(w)M (w) dw = f pV

(23)

where V = R A(w)M (w) dw. Suppose that either f pV is small (of order 1 or less), or any
interference from distant spacetime points is largely independent, so that the distribution of the
number of interfering species will be approximately Poisson. The probability that no species
interferes will then be exp(−f pV ), and hence the probability that someone with your memories
exists will be

P (someone like you exists) = p exp(−f pV )

(24)

This is maximized when p = 1 / f V , corresponding to f pV = 1. Thus we see that although
FNC favours as large a value of p as possible when there are no interactions between species, this
is not true when interactions such as those modeled here exist, thereby justifying the comments
at the end of Section 6.2.

The Fermi Paradox now seems unsurprising. If the expected number of other intelligent species
to inﬂuence earth, which is equal to f pV , is around one, we should not be especially surprised
that we have not seen evidence of any other species. We still have no speciﬁc explanation of what
factors are responsible for this, however. In the other direction, discovery of another intelligent
species would also not be surprising, especially if we looked somewhat more widely than the
region where a species would have inﬂuenced us without eﬀort on our part.

Further analysis requires some assumptions about your uncertainty regarding p and f .

If
many unknown factors aﬀect p and f , in a multiplicative fashion, it may be reasonable (due to
the Central Limit Theorem) to suppose that log(p) and log(f ) have Gaussian prior distributions.
It is also plausible that p and f are independent, a priori.

Multiplying this prior density for log(p) and log(f ) by the probability that you exist for given
values of p and f , from equation (24), and renormalizing, gives the posterior joint probability
density for log(p) and log(f ). This density is not analytically tractable, but is easily displayed
graphically by means of a sample of points, as shown in the accompanying ﬁgure. Note that
the numerical magnitude of p depends on exactly how detailed your memories are, and hence
is probably not of much interest. The scale of f is arbitrary, since it can be compensated for
by a change in the scale of A(w), and hence of V . It is convenient to set the scale of f so that
the mean of log(p) + log(f ) is zero. The parameters of interest are then the value of V and the
standard deviations of log(p) and log(f ). The top-left plot shows a sample of 500 points from
the prior with standard deviation for log10(p) of 1.25, giving a 95% central interval for p that
spans a range of 105, and standard deviation for log10(f ) of 0.75, giving a 95% central interval
for f that spans a range of 103.

The remaining plots in the ﬁgure show samples of points from the posterior for log(p) and
log(f ) when V is 0.1, 1, and 10. The lines shown are where log10(p) + log10(f ) = − log10(V ),
indicating for each f the value of p that maximizes the probability that someone with your
memories exists.11 Larger values of V correspond to a greater potential for another species to
develop and then interfere with your existence, a potential that is modulated by same factor,
p, that controls the likelihood of your development. Accordingly, larger values of V shift the

11Some details: The eﬀect of the factor p in equation (24) is to shift the mean of log10(p) by 1.252 log(10), with
the distribution remaining Gaussian with the same standard deviation. The remaining factor of exp(−f pV ) is
never greater than one, so rejection sampling can be used to obtain the posterior sample.

posterior distribution towards smaller values of p. The posterior distribution of f is also shifted
towards smaller values (more so for large V ), since smaller values of f reduce the probability
that another species will interfere.

We can now determine the eﬀect of FNC on your uncertainty concerning one factor that enters
into p. Let us write p = p0p1, where p1 is a single relevant factor, such as the probability that
multi-cellular life will evolve from single-celled life, and p0 is the product of all other factors.
Suppose that p0 and p1 are independent, and that your prior distribution for log10(p1) is Gaussian
with mean log10(0.1) and standard deviation 0.2, giving a 95% central interval for p1 of 0.041
to 0.247, and a mean for p1 of 0.111. (Your prior for log10(p0) will therefore be Gaussian with

standard deviation √1.252 − 0.22 = 1.234.) The conditional distribution for log10(p1) given

log10(p) is Gaussian with mean given by

E[log10(p1) | log10(p)]

= E[log10(p1)] + ( log10(p) − E[log10(p)]) Var[log10(p1)] / Var[log10(p)]
= log10(0.1) + ( log10(p) − E[log10(p)]) 0.22/1.252
= log10(0.1) + 0.0256 ( log10(p) − E[log10(p)])

and variance given by

Var[log10(p1) | log10(p)] = Var[log10(p1)] (1 − Var[log10(p1)] / Var[log10(p)])

= 0.22 (1 − 0.22/1.252) = 0.0390

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

To ﬁnd the posterior mean of log10(p1) given that someone with your memories exists, we take
the mean of (27) with respect to the posterior distribution of log10(p). The posterior variance
of log10(p1) is the sum of (29) and the variance of (27) with respect to the posterior distribution
of log10(p).

If V = 0, so other intelligent species have no eﬀect on earth, the result of this computation
is that the posterior mean and standard deviation of log10(p1) are log10(0.1236) and 0.2, which
give a 95% central interval of 0.050 to 0.305, and a posterior mean for p1 of 0.137. When V = 0,
the posterior distribution of log10(p1) is Gaussian, and is the same as would be obtained if p1
were the only uncertain factor. There is a signiﬁcant “Presumptuous Philosopher” eﬀect from
applying FNC, although it is not as large in magnitude as some previous examples.

In contrast, the eﬀect of FNC on the distribution of p1 is much less when V is of signiﬁcant
size, even though, as can be seen in the plots, the posterior distribution of p itself is quite diﬀerent
from the prior. The posterior mean and standard deviation of log10(p1) are log10(0.1080) and
0.1985 when V = 0.1, log10(0.1042) and 0.1984 when V = 1, and log10(0.1003) and 0.1984 when
V = 10. The posterior means of p1 for these values of V are 0.120, 0.116, and 0.111. The last
is nearly identical to the prior mean of p1, so there is almost no “Presumptuous Philosopher”
eﬀect on inference regarding this single factor of p when V = 10. With larger values of V , it is
possible for the posterior mean of p1 to be less than the prior mean.

When V = 0, the posterior distribution of f is the same as the prior, but with larger V , the
posterior favours smaller values for f , as can be seen in the plots. We can look at a single factor
entering into f , just as we did for p.
If we write f = f0f1, we can proceed much as above.
Suppose the prior for log10(f1) is Gaussian with mean log10(0.1) and standard deviation 0.2,

40

giving a prior mean for f1 of 0.111. The posterior mean of f1 is 0.111, 0.097, 0.093, and 0.089
for V = 0, V = 0.1, V = 1, and V = 10. A substantial change occurs when you condition on
someone with your memories existing, with the eﬀect increasing as V increases.

This is disturbing, since many of the factors contributing to f — such as the probability of
a technological civilization avoiding self-destruction, and the probability that interstellar travel
is feasible — are also relevant to human prospects, with larger values being more favourable.
(However, some other factors going into f , such as the probability that an intelligent species
will decide to destroy the potential habitat of another intelligent species, are ones that many of
us would not wish to be large.) There is thus a “doomsday” aspect to this analysis, since use of
FNC has revealed that we should increase the probability we assign to some negative scenarios,
above the probability we would assign based on ordinary considerations. The source of this
pessimism is quite diﬀerent from that of the Doomsday Argument of Section 4, however. It is
based on the empirical observation that we are not aware of any other intelligent species. One
possible explanation of this observation is that most intelligent species are destroyed in some
fashion, or at least fail to develop in a way that would make their presence known to us. This
is a reason to increase our assessment of the probability of this happening to us.

The magnitude of pessimism that this argument warrants depends on our beliefs regarding a
wide range of topics in physics, astronomy, biology, and sociology. In contrast, the Doomsday
Argument depends only on the size of the future human population in diﬀerent scenarios, and
can produce very large probabilities of “doom” if the alternative is a future involving interstellar
colonization, or even just intensive settlement of the solar system. Arguments based on FNC
are unlikely to produce such extreme pessimism.

7.2 Inﬂation and inﬁnite universes

Cosmological theories in which an early period of “inﬂation” greatly expands the universe imply
that the universe we are in is inﬁnite in size.12 Furthermore, in most such cosmologies, our
universe is only one of many within a larger “multiverse”. Finally, these theories do not produce
any tight linkage between distant parts of the universe, which might constrain them either to
be similar in detail, or diﬀerent. It follows that in an inﬂationary universe we should expect all
possible observers to exist, each an inﬁnite number of times. In particular, there should be an
inﬁnite number of distant observers with exactly your current memories.

This is a problem for FNC. If you accept inﬂationary cosmology as correct, someone with
your memories exists with probability one, regardless of what else might be true. Conditioning
on the existence of someone with your memories will then have no eﬀect on the probabilities
of any other theories. In particular, FNC no longer provides a solution to the Freak Observers
problem (Section 5).

However, an inﬁnite universe leads to many other problems as well. For example, Knobe,
Olum, and Vilenkin (2006) discuss the ethical implications of an inﬁnite universe. These and
other issues with inﬁnities do not seem at all clear to me. As an interim solution, I advocate
simply ignoring the problem of inﬁnity, which is certainly what everyone does in everyday life.

My primary justiﬁcation for ignoring the problems FNC has with inﬁnity is that the ﬁnite

12At least according to Knobe, Olum, and Vilenkin (2006), though Olum (2004) says models of ﬁnite inﬂationary

universes can be contrived.

41

size necessary to cause problems is extraordinary large. As discussed in Section 5, for duplicate
observers to exist, the universe must be a huge number of orders of magnitude greater than
the portion of the universe we presently observe. Can the diﬀerence between an unimaginably
vast universe and one that is truly inﬁnite actually be crucial to our inferences regarding local
matters, which concern only the small region within a few tens of billions of light years of us?

Conceivably, the answer is yes. But it seems more likely to me that either the inﬁnity will
disappear once the theory is better understood, or it will turn out that its implications, at
least for the questions dealt with here, are not great. The situation is analogous to thought
experiments with extreme assumptions, where (as discussed in Section 2.5) there is a danger
that our reasoning will implicitly use premises that are not true given these extreme assumptions.
The diﬀerence, of course, is that the extreme assumption in this case concerns reality, and may
ultimately prove unavoidable. But it seems best to try to avoid it at least initially.

Some technical matters also support the strategy of ignoring inﬁnity. First, even if the universe
we are in is inﬁnite, our knowledge of it is certainly not inﬁnite, since distant parts of the universe
are outside our past light-cone, due to the universe’s ﬁnite age. This is fortunate, since if we
were subjected to non-negligible inﬂuences from every part of an inﬁnite universe, our experience
would be a incomprehensible jumble. (This is just a more general form of Olbers’ Paradox —
that if the universe is inﬁnite, the night sky should be white.) Should the inﬁnite regions with
which we have had no contact really count as part of “our” universe? One might argue that they
should, one the grounds the we might be in contact with them in the future. Whether this is
so depends on details of the universe’s expansion, but let’s suppose that any two regions of the
universe, even very distant ones, will eventually come into contact. Who will receive information
from such distant regions? You will likely be dead, but suppose instead that you have achieved
immortality. If you are actually attending to news from distant regions, you must be expanding
your memory. But any increase in your memory results in a huge increase in the size of universe
needed for a duplicate observer with your exact memories to exist. So it is diﬃcult to imagine
any scenario in which the existence of duplicate observers has observational consequences.

It is therefore not surprising that the puzzle presented by Olum (2004) as arising from in-
ﬂationary cosmology is not really dependent on the universe being inﬁnite.13 Olum considers
the probability that an intelligent species will colonizing its galaxy (or even many galaxies),
and thereby achieve an enormous population (eg, 1019 individuals), and concludes that the
probability of a species doing this, while perhaps substantially less than one, is not minuscule.
Accordingly, one would expect most intelligent observers to belong to such a galactic civilization.
Yet we don’t. Olum sees this as a conﬂict between observation and “anthropic reasoning”, by
which he means SSA−SIA.14 If you consider yourself to be a randomly selected observer, as
advocated by SSA, you should very likely be either a member of some other species that has
colonized their galaxy, or be a human from later in our history, when we have done so.

Although Olum doesn’t present it as such, this is essentially the Doomsday Argument (applied
in the context of many species, as in Section 4.4), except that Olum is suﬃciently conﬁdent that

13A universe of the size we observe probably suﬃces. A bigger universe could be necessary if for some reason life
is extraordinary rare, but if so, the larger size will not cause problems for FNC, since the probability of duplicate
observers will also be lower if life is rare. It is possible that Olum sees an inﬁnite universe as necessary to justify
use of SSA, thinking it would then be the only way to avoid the Freak Observers problem.

14Previously (Olum 2002), he had advocated SSA+SIA, but he apparently had doubts about SIA at the time

of this paper, and more recently (Knobe, Olum, and Vilenkin 2006).

42

doom is not nearly universal that he regards the result of the argument as a paradox rather
than a prediction. Trying to resolve the paradox, he considers the possibility that “anthropic
reasoning” (SSA−SIA) is invalid, along with other possibilities (eg, galactic colonization is ac-
tually exceedingly diﬃcult). He comes to no deﬁnite conclusion, but considers that several of
these possibilities might together be suﬃcient to explain the conﬂict.

My conclusion is that “anthropic reasoning” — meaning SSA−SIA — is indeed invalid. In
contrast, application of FNC produces no paradox. Suppose we know that intelligent species
are very rare, and hence seldom interact, so that we can ignore the complexities discussed in
Section 7.1. The probability of an observer such as you existing, as a member of a species that
has not colonized the galaxy, is determined by factors inﬂuencing the evolution of species up
to our stage of development. It is irrelevant what happens to these species later; hence it is
irrelevant whether, for example, galactic colonization is easy or hard.15

Anthropic reasoning has also been applied to theories in which multiple inﬂating universes
can have diﬀerent values of fundamental physical parameters, in particular the “cosmological
constant”, which inﬂuences how rapidly the universe expands. The observed value of the cos-
mological constant is close to, but not exactly, zero. The most well-accepted theories of the
cosmological constant provide no apparent reason for it to be as small as it is — it might equally
well have any value over a range that is 10120 larger than its actual value. However, Wein-
berg (1987) calculated that only a much narrower range of values around zero will lead to the
formation of galaxies, which he considered a prerequisite for life to exist. Since subsequent mea-
surements found a non-zero value in this range, this calculation has been taken to be a successful
prediction using the Anthropic Principle. I will critique such reasoning below in connection with
string theory, where this and related anthropic arguments have recently become prominent.

7.3 The landscape of string theory

String theory is an attempt to unify Einstein’s theory of gravity with the “Standard Model”,
which describes electromagnetism and the weak and strong nuclear forces. String theorists
originally hoped that the requirement of mathematical consistency would produce a unique
theory, which would predict the previously unexplained parameters of the Standard Model,
such as the masses of elementary particles. Though this possibility has not been deﬁnitely ruled
out, many string theorists now think it more likely that hundreds of parameters of the theory
can be varied while retaining consistency. This results in a huge “landscape” of possible physical
laws, with perhaps 10500 or more possibilities, each of which produces diﬀerent values for the
parameters of the Standard Model, and for the cosmological constant. The universe sits in
a “valley” in this landscape, to which it “descended” during its inﬂationary period. If a huge
number of inﬂating universes formed, or if, following the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics, a single universe has a huge number of superposed versions, almost all valleys of the
landscape will be populated by one or more universes. The landscape will then describe not just
a set of mathematical possibilities, but an actual multitude of real universes.

This view of string theory and cosmology has been advocated by Susskind (2003, 2006), who

15Two explanations considered by Olum are not irrelevant: We are part of a galactic civilization without being
aware of it, or (perhaps a special case of this) we don’t actually live on earth, but rather exist in a computer
simulation. Both possibilities could increase the probability of someone with your memories existing, and hence
might be favoured by FNC.

43

then uses it as a basis for anthropic reasoning. In his view, the particular values of the physical
parameters we observe, and indeed, even the set of particles we see, cannot be explained by the
requirements of any fundamental theory, but they can be explained (at least partially) by the
requirement that the universe contain intelligent observers such as ourselves, since otherwise
there would be no one to look for an explanation. In other words, we measure the values of
the physical constants that we do because only these values (or similar values) allow for the
existence of someone to measure them.

Unfortunately, Susskind is not too clear on the exact purpose of this reasoning, or its justi-
ﬁcation. Before attempting to critique his views, I will try to clarify the issues by discussing
what one might conclude by applying FNC.

As discussed in Section 7.2, inﬁnite universes pose a problem for FNC. Accordingly, I will
suppose that the landscape is populated by only around 10600 universes (more than enough to
guarantee at least one in each of 10500 valleys) and that each universe has at most 10350 galaxies
(much more than the 1011 we can observe in our universe). If each galaxy has 1010 inhabited
planets, each of which has a generous 1020 inhabitants, who are replaced by equal numbers for
1020 generations, the total number of intelligent observers in all universes who ever exist will be
at most 101000. As discussed in Section 5, this is far too few for there to be any non-negligible
chance of another observer with your exact memories existing.

In this scenario, we can apply FNC without diﬃculty. Conceivably, the answers we obtain
might not be correct if in reality there are an inﬁnite number of universes of truly inﬁnite
extent. However, in none of the anthropic arguments I am aware of does such a distinction
between unimaginably vast and truly inﬁnite universes play any apparent role.
If inﬁnity is
actually crucial, the proponents of anthropic arguments need to make the reason for this more
explicit.

Consider two cosmological theories, in both of which there are 10600 universes formed by
inﬂation.
In theory L, these universes populate a huge number of valleys in a landscape of
possible physical laws, as described above. In theory S, there is either no landscape, perhaps
because the requirement of mathematical consistency uniquely determines physical laws, or the
landscape has only a single valley, which has much the same eﬀect once inﬂation is over. If string
theory is accepted as the correct foundation of physics, and its basic principles are not in dispute,
whether L or S is the correct theory may be a mathematical question, whose answer we are
ignorant of only because of the diﬃculty of performing the necessary calculations. Alternatively,
L and S may have diﬀerent foundations, even though they both lead to similar collections of
inﬂating universes. In either case, suppose that, on mathematical and physical grounds, you
judge the two theories to be equally plausible. What should you judge the probabilities of these
theories to be after applying FNC, conditioning on all your memories, both of everyday life, and
of the results of whatever scientiﬁc measurements have been performed?

We can distinguish two situations. First, suppose that the unique parameters underlying
theory S are known, and that at least some of the implications of these fundamental parameters
for the parameters of the Standard Model and for the value of the cosmological constant have
been worked out.
If the implications of
theory S1 contradict experimental measurements, we can clearly rule out S1, and conclude that
theory L is true (assuming that these are the only alternatives). Note that “measurement”
includes general observations, such as the existence of galaxies, which may rule out certain

I’ll refer to this version of theory S as theory S1.

44

values for parameters of the Standard Model or for the cosmological constant. Alternatively,
the fundamental parameters of theory S1 may produced parameters for the Standard Model and
cosmological constant that lie within the region, Y , that so far as you know is compatible with
observation. The probability that someone with your memories will exist according to theory
S1 will then be 10600 times the probability that a universe with parameters in Y will produce
an observer with your memories.16 On the other hand, the probability that someone exists with
your memories under theory L will be 10600 times the fraction of valleys in the landscape that
produce parameters in region Y times the probability that a universe with parameters in Y will
produce an observer with your memories. The odds in favour of theory L will therefore be equal
to the fraction of valleys in the landscape that produce parameters in Y .17 The landscape of
string theory is typically seen as containing valleys with a great diversity of physical laws, so
the odds in favour of L in this scenario would be tiny — ie, theory S1 would be very strongly
favoured.

In the second situation, the fundamental parameters for theory S are unknown. Perhaps, for
example, it has been proved that the structure of theory S (but not theory L) must lead to a
unique set of parameters, but their actual values are not known, though mathematical intuition
allows one to give them some broad prior distribution. Or theory S might just baldly state
that the universes that exist have only a single set of parameter values, but these values are
arbitrary, with some broad prior distribution. I’ll use S∗ to refer to a theory S of this type. In
this situation, the probability that someone with your memories exists under S∗ is equal to 10600
times the prior probability of region Y times the probability that someone with your memories
will exist in a universe whose parameters are in Y . The odds in favour of theory L will be equal
to the fraction of valleys that produce parameters in Y according to L divided by the prior
probability of Y according to S. If the distribution of parameters of valleys in L is similar in
breadth to the prior for parameters in S∗, these odds will be roughly one — ie, neither theory
will be favoured, since neither gives any very speciﬁc predictions.

In these arguments, a crucial role is played by the region Y , which encompasses values of the
parameters of the Standard Model and of the cosmological constant that are not ruled out by
your memories (including your memories of scientiﬁc measurements). In contrast, it is irrelevant
what region of parameters is compatible with life, or with intelligent life, or with intelligent life
that has developed a scientiﬁc culture. These regions would likely be much bigger than Y , since
there is no apparent reason why, for instance, life couldn’t develop in a universe with only half
as many galaxies as we see.

These applications of FNC accord with usual scientiﬁc reasoning. If theory S makes speciﬁc
predictions, and these are compatible with what is observed, it is favoured over theory L, since
L makes no speciﬁc predictions. If theory S also makes no speciﬁc predictions, either because
it has not been suﬃciently worked out, or because it has arbitrary parameters, then neither S
nor L are favoured.

How is this diﬀerent from “anthropic” reasoning? The crucial point seems to be that theory
S1, whose parameters are known, and match observations, implies that 10600 universes much like

16This probability is (at least roughly) the same for all universes with parameters in Y , since Y is deﬁned to

be the region of parameters that can’t be ruled out based on your memories.

17It’s possible that theory L deﬁnes some non-uniform measure over valleys, in which case the odds would be
the total measure for valleys in region Y divided by the total measure for all valleys. This elaboration does not
aﬀect the basic argument.

45

ours exist. In contrast, theory L implies that far fewer universes like ours, or even compatible
with life, will exist. (Though it is assumed that theory L implies the existence of at least one
universe with intelligent life.) If one applied SSA+SIA, the prior probability of theory S1 would
be greatly boosted compared to that of theory L, and the result would be the same as applying
FNC. But if one instead applies SSA−SIA, there is no boost for theory S1. The crux of the
“anthropic” argument seems to be that one should not penalize theory L for predicting that
only a few habitable universes exist, as long as it predicts at least one, since we will naturally
ﬁnd ourselves in a habitable universe, even if they are rare. As a result, the degree to which
theory S1 is favoured over theory L is much reduced.

A numerical example may clarify the situation. Suppose that the landscape of theory L
has 10500 valleys, whereas theory S1 has only one valley, whose properties are known. The
single valley of theory S1 is compatible with intelligent life, and furthermore, with your spe-
ciﬁc memories. Of the 10500 valleys of theory L, 1010 are compatible with intelligent life, and
106 of these are compatible with your speciﬁc memories. For simplicity, let’s assume that all
universes with intelligent life have the same population. Application of FNC then gives odds
of 106/10500 = 10−494 for theory L, but the anthropic reasoning described above, based on
SSA−SIA, gives odds of 106/1010 = 10−4 for L. So whereas L is essentially disproved if FNC is
used, it retains a non-negligible probability under SSA−SIA. This result may seem reasonable if
you take an anthropic view, but note the disturbing sensitivity of the odds for L to the deﬁnition
of “intelligent life”, and the need to determine whether such life exists in universes with 10500
diﬀerent physical laws before a conclusion can be reached.

This situation resembles that discussed in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, where Marochnik’s theory and
other theories in which the density of observers vary were considered. I argued there that the
results of FNC and SSA+SIA are correct using the device of companion observers. In the context
of inﬂationary cosmology, the “companions” would need to exist in every universe, regardless
of whether it is hospitable to us, even though the physical laws diﬀer radically from universe to
universe. Suppose there are a great many such observers in every universe (albeit unobserved
by us, so far), and that they know that observers like them exist in every universe. They will
take the existence of humans in this universe as evidence that many universes have physical
laws that allow beings like humans to exist. Why should we think diﬀerently? One might well
wonder whether this scenario is stretching the concept of companion observers too far, but I see
no speciﬁc reason for thinking that these conclusions are inappropriate.

Susskind does not discuss anthropic reasoning in terms of probabilistic principles such as
SSA−SIA, nor in reference to any explicit comparison of theories. Instead, his focus seems to be
on ﬁnding an explanation for our universe’s physical laws. In his book, The Cosmic Landscape,
he describes how he came to accept use of the Anthropic Principle, beginning with an account
of the many “coincidences” that seem necessary for life to exist:

There are multiple ways that things could go wrong with the nuclear cooking [ of
. . . But again, it would do no good for the nuclear physics to
heavy elements ].
be “just right” if the universe had no stars.
. . . How then did the universe get to
have such a large preponderance of matter over antimatter? . . . Another essential
requirement for life is that gravity be extremely weak. . . .

Just how seriously should we take this collection of lucky coincidences? Do they
really make a strong case for some kind of Anthropic Principle? My own feeling is

46

that they are very impressive, but no so impressive that they would have pushed me
past the tipping point to embrace an anthropic explanation. . . . accidents, after all,
do happen.

However, the smallness of the cosmological constant is another matter. To make
the ﬁrst 119 decimal places of the vacuum energy zero is most certainly no accident.
But it was not just that the cosmological constant was very small. Had it been even
smaller than it is, had it continued to be zero to the current level of accuracy, one
could have gone on believing that some unknown mathematical principle would make
it exactly zero. . . .

But even the cosmological constant would not have been enough to tip the balance
for me. For me the tipping point came with the discovery of the huge Landscape
that String Theory appears to be forcing on us. (Susskind 2006, pp. 182-185)

I will discuss the cosmological constant in more detail below, but for now let us count it as just
one more “lucky coincidence”. The last point above seems crucial. He expands on it later:

in my own mind, the “straw that broke the camel’s back” was the realization
. . .
that String Theory was moving in what seemed to be a perverse direction. Instead
of zeroing in on a single, unique system of physical laws, it was yielding an ever-
expanding collection of Rube Goldberg concoctions. I felt that the goal of a single
unique string world was an ever-receding mirage and that the theorists looking for
such a unique world were on a doomed mission. (Susskind 2006, p. 199)

In terms of theories of type S and L discussed above, it appears that Susskind initially saw
string theory as a theory S∗, for which it was believed (though not proven) that the fundamental
parameters of the theory were unique, even though they were unknown. If he had thought to
compare it to some theory L (obviously based on some diﬀerent structure), and had applied
FNC, he would have concluded that the two theories were about equally likely, since at that
point neither could make speciﬁc predictions. Of course, he would have hoped to ﬁnd the
unknown unique parameters of S, and he would have hoped that the predictions of theory S
with these parameters matched observations. If both hopes had been fulﬁlled, application of
FNC would have produced the conclusion that this theory (now of type S1) was vastly more
probable than theory L. Perhaps these applications of FNC approximate the logic Susskind
employed at that time.

After abandoning the quest for a unique set of physical laws, accepting instead a landscape of
possible laws, populated by multiple universes, Susskind appears to have been concerned with
only one competing theory — that the particular laws we see were chosen by an Intelligent
Designer, with the purpose of creating a universe containing life. It is this alternative that his
anthropic arguments appear aimed at refuting, or at least rendering unnecessary. In his book,
which is subtitled “The Illusion of Intelligent Design”, he writes:

To Victor’s [ a friend’s ] question, “Was it not God’s inﬁnite kindness and love
that permitted our existence?” I would have to answer with Laplace’s reply to
Napol´eon: “I have no need of this hypothesis.” The Cosmic Landscape is my
answer. . . (Susskind 2006, p. 15)

Obtaining this answer doesn’t require anthropic reasoning, however. Intelligent Design can
be seen as a theory S∗ in which all universes operate by a single set of physical laws that are

47

ﬁxed to arbitrarily values by the Designer. Supposing we have some broad prior distribution
for the parameters of these physical laws, we ﬁnd that the theory makes no speciﬁc predictions.
Application of FNC leads to the conclusion that this theory and theory L are about equally
likely. There is “no need” for the hypothesis of an Intelligent Designer.

I’ll call this theory SD.

An advocate of Intelligent Design might, of course, maintain that a broad prior is not ap-
propriate — that the prior should be conﬁned to physical laws that will produce a universe
containing intelligent life.
If you consider SD and L equally likely
a priori, FNC will lead you to conclude that theory SD is much more probable than theory L
— extending the numerical example above, theory SD will predict that the universe has one of
the 1010 sets of laws that are compatible with intelligent life, of which 106 are compatible with
your observations, so the odds in favour of L will be (106/10500) / (106/1010) = 10−490. But
why should one think the Designer wished intelligent life to exist, as one must to regard SD as
plausible? Some may think this, but an argument that has as a premise God’s inﬁnite kindness
and love for humanity is not a scientiﬁc argument, and requires no scientiﬁc refutation.

Nevertheless, if one wishes a counter-argument, anthropic reasoning may appear to provide
one. Applying SSA−SIA will make the theories of the landscape (L) and of an Intelligent
Designer who likes intelligent life (SD) equally likely. Of the 10500 valleys in theory L, only
the 1010 with intelligent life “count” when applying SSA−SIA, so the probability of a universe
compatible with what you observe is 106/1010, the same as for theory SD.

I have argued in this paper that SSA−SIA is not a valid principle of reasoning. If so, one
would expect Susskind’s approach to produce strange results in other contexts. Consider a
comparison of Susskind’s theory L, in which there is a landscape of 10500 possible physical laws,
with a theory S∗ that other string theorists may still be working on, in which it is thought
that only one of these 10500 apparent possibilities is mathematically consistent, though it is not
known which of the 10500 it is. As discussed above, applying FNC leads to the conclusion that
S∗ and L are equally likely. What is the result of applying SSA−SIA?

SSA−SIA will strongly favour theory L. In the numerical example above, theory L would
predict a universe compatible with what you see with probability 106/1010 = 10−4, since of the
1010 valleys in the landscape that allow intelligent life, 106 are compatible with your observations.
The corresponding probability under theory S∗ is only 106/10500 = 10−494, so it is very strongly
disfavoured, with the odds in favour of L being 10−4/10−494 = 10490. Another way of looking
at this problem is to split theory S∗ into theories S 1, S 2, . . . , S 10500
, one for each possible set of
physical laws, and split the prior probability of 1/2 for S∗ into prior probabilities of 0.5× 10−500
for each of these theories. All but 106 of these theories are incompatible with your observations.
The total posterior probability of all the sub-theories of S∗ that are compatible with what you
see works out to 106 × 0.5 × 10−500 / (106 × 0.5 × 10−500 + 0.5 × 10−4) ≈ 10−490.

This seems unreasonable. Perhaps there are good reasons to think that the old research
programme of looking for unique physical laws within string theory has poor prospects, but until
it is actually proved hopeless, its chances of success are surely not as low as 10−490. Susskind
does not explicitly draw such a pessimistic conclusion, but it seems to follow from the logic of
anthropic reasoning that he uses.

Susskind does draw an even more surprising conclusion from the anthropic viewpoint. Dis-
cussing the idea that the laws of physics might be an emergent phenomenon, of the sort that is

48

well-known in condensed-matter physics, he writes:

The properties of emergent systems are not very ﬂexible. There may be an enormous
variety of starting points for the microscopic behavior of atoms, but. . .
they tend
to lead to a very small number of large-scale endpoints.
. . . This insensitivity to
the microscopic starting point is the thing that condensed-matter physicists like
best about emergent systems. But the probability that out of the small number of
possible ﬁxed points (endpoints) there should be one with the incredibly ﬁne-tuned
properties of our anthropic world is negligible. . . . A universe based on conventional
condensed-matter emergence seems to me to be a dead-end idea. (Susskind 2006,
pp. 359-360)

This comment is remarkable. An inﬂexible theory leading to only a small number of possible
sets of physical laws (preferably just one) is what Susskind had originally hoped string theory
would be! Yet now he sees such a theory as being almost certainly false, not (just) because
of detailed problems with it, but because of the very inﬂexibility, leading to near uniqueness,
that he previously saw as one of the most attractive features of string theory. Moreover, even
application of SSA−SIA does not lead to this theory being greatly disfavoured, if the details have
not been worked out that would show what the small number of possibilities actually predict.
Rather than 10500 sub-theories as in the example above, there are only, say, 10 sub-theories,
each of which has a substantial portion of the prior probability for the theory as a whole. The
low probability Susskind assigns to this theory can only come from his assigning a low prior
probability to the whole theory, based on a prior belief that physical laws do not have any simple
explanation, but are instead a “Rube Goldberg concoction”.

Such a belief is, of course, contradicted by numerous scientiﬁc success stories, such as the use
of quantum mechanics to explain the complex features of atomic spectra. However, some other
complex phenomena do seem to have no explanation other than accident — the outlines of the
continents, for example, have no fundamental geological explanation. Whether a phenomenon
has a simple explanation or not cannot be determined a priori. Perhaps a multiplicity of uni-
verses with diﬀering physical laws exist; perhaps the set of possible physical laws is much more
constrained. One can tell which only by creating and testing theories of both sorts.

Anthropic reasoning has also been criticized by Smolin (2006), who has in addition proposed a
third possibility — universes with a great diversity of physical laws can indeed exist, but rather
than the physical laws of each universe being chosen at random from some simple distribution,
they are chosen according to some dynamical process, which leads to a distribution of universes
in which the physical laws we actually observe are much more likely. He proposes a particular
theory of “cosmic natural selection”, based on the idea that new universes are formed inside
black holes, with slightly perturbed physical laws. Selection will then tend to favour physical
laws that make a universe produce many black holes. Smolin argues that such a universe will
resemble ours.

A successful theory of this sort would be greatly favoured by FNC, in comparison with a theory
that distributes universes uniformly over valleys of the landscape, since it would (if successful)
greatly increase the probability of a universe similar to ours (in the region Y deﬁned earlier),
and hence also the probability that someone with your memories will exist. In contrast, such
a theory might not be favoured at all by SSA−SIA. Universes without intelligent life “don’t
count” with SSA−SIA, so if Smolin’s theory (for example) leads to many more universes that

49

contain intelligent life, but fails to further concentrate the distribution towards universes more
precisely like ours, it will not be considered more probable by SSA−SIA than a theory in which
the physical laws for each universe are drawn from a much broader distribution.

As promised above, I will now consider in more detail the issue of the cosmological constant,
which is usually denoted by Λ. As seen from the quote above, Susskind considers the observed
small, but non-zero, value for Λ to be the strongest of the “coincidences” that led him to consider
anthropic explanations. Two separate aspects of the situation seem responsible for this — the
large magnitude of the coincidence, and the special role of the value zero.

The range of values for Λ that are compatible with life (taken to be the range for which galaxies
form) is much narrower than the range of values that seem plausible on general theoretical
grounds, by a factor of roughly 10120. This ratio of prior range to “anthropic” range (for which
life can exist) is substantially greater than for the other parameters of the Standard Model that
seem to be “ﬁne-tuned” for life. Someone who accepts the basic anthropic argument (based, so
far as I can tell, on SSA−SIA) will naturally be impressed by this. As I argue above, however,
application of FNC does not lead one to favour a theory based on the landscape for this reason,
so the magnitude of the coincidence is irrelevant.

Does the fact that the observed value of Λ is close to zero, but not exactly zero, modify this
conclusion? Consider some other parameter, for which the range of conceivable values is (0, 1)
and the range of values compatible with life is (0.3181, 0.3192). The best measurement of this
parameter gives the 95% conﬁdence interval (0.3185, 0.3187). Suppose you consider an anthropic
explanation for the value of this parameter to be attractive. Someone now advances a plausible
theory that the true value is exactly 1/π = 0.3183 . . ., which is somewhat at variance with the
measurement, but not hopelessly so. After learning of this theory, should your conﬁdence in
an anthropic explanation be greater or less than before? Surely you should be less conﬁdent,
since it’s possible that this new theory provides the true explanation. Certainly you shouldn’t
be more conﬁdent in an anthropic explanation now that before.

Analogously, the fact that the anthropic range for the cosmological constant includes the
special value zero, which one might imagine could result from some theoretical constraint en-
forcing cancellation of terms, does not make an anthropic explanation more likely, but rather
the reverse. This is partly because of the possibility that Λ is indeed exactly zero, even though
current observations indicate otherwise. More likely, however, is that some theory might explain
why Λ is close to, but not exactly, zero.

Even if no good non-anthropic explanation for Λ being near zero can be found, the anthropic
explanation may have its own problem — why is the special value zero contained in the rather
narrow anthropic range (about 102 wide compared with a prior range of 10120)? The anthropic
range of Λ is a function of the other parameters of the physical laws. Why should these other
parameters conspire to make this range contain zero? Perhaps there is some plausible cosmo-
logical explanation, valid even when the set of particles is much diﬀerent from what we observe,
but I have not seen the issue discussed.

To summarize, at least the following seem possible explanations for the value of Λ:

1) Λ must be exactly zero, for theoretical reasons.

2) Λ has a speciﬁc value that is close to but not equal to zero, for theoretical reasons.

50

3) Λ has a value that is not completely determined theoretically, but which theory says is

likely to be close to zero.

4) Λ takes on various values in diﬀerent valleys of the landscape. A non-negligible fraction

of these values are close to zero, with the others being widely distributed.

5) Λ takes on various values in diﬀerent valleys of the landscape, with no tendency for these

values to be close to zero.

Explanation (1) is viable only if current observations are in error. A theory of the sort required for
explanation (2) would seem on general grounds to be conceivable — reasons for something to be
zero often can be modiﬁed to produced reasons for something to be near zero. Explanations (3)
and (4) are not entirely distinct. Smolin’s cosmic natural selection theory (Smolin 2006) and a
recent cyclic model of the universe due to Steinhardt and Turok (2006) provide explanations of
this type. Explanation (5) provides a reason to think that a small value of Λ is possible, but
explains why we see such a rare value only if you accept anthropic explanations.

Arguments in favour of an anthropic explanation for the cosmological constant seem to gener-
ally dismiss explanations (1) to (4), though Weinberg (2000) remarks that an a priori distribu-
tion for Λ with a peak near zero would obviate anthropic explanations. If only explanation (5) is
considered, however, anthropic reasoning does no actual work, but just makes one feel more com-
fortable. The real question is whether the Anthropic Principle provides good reason to increase
the probability of explanation (5) compared to the others. The eﬀect of applying SSA−SIA,
as discussed earlier, is to let a theory predict many lifeless universes (eg, with Λ ≫ 0) without
penalty, as long as it predicts at least one universe with intelligent life. In contrast, when FNC
is applied, explanation (5) is heavily penalized compared to an otherwise plausible theory that
provides an explanation of type (1) to (4). (This assumes that all theories produces a similar
collection of universes — if not, we get into the diﬃcult problem (discussed in Section 6.3) of
comparing theories that diﬀer in the size or multiplicity of universes.)

My conclusion is that when FNC can be clearly applied, it does not support the type of an-
thropic reasoning that has been used to “explain” the apparent ﬁne-tuning of physical constants
to values necessary for life, via a multitude of universes populating a landscape of physical laws.
Such anthropic reasoning appears to be based on SSA−SIA, and shares with it a disturbing
sensitivity to the reference class chosen. Moreover, SSA−SIA, in both this application and
its applications to the problems discussed previously, can produce counterintuitive conclusions.
When the universe is truly inﬁnite, and especially when diﬀerent theories predict universes of
diﬀerent sizes, some more general version of FNC is needed. However, I see no reason at present
to think that my conclusions regarding anthropic reasoning would be invalid in these situations.

None of this says that a cosmology with multiple universes populating a landscape of physical
laws cannot be correct. FNC does give a preference to theories of this sort in which the distri-
bution of universes is concentrated on valleys in the landscape that produce the physical laws
we see, but perhaps no such theory is viable. Many ordinary phenomena, such as the outlines
of the continents and the radii of the orbits of the planets, are believed to have no explanation
other than accident. On cannot rule out a priori the possibility that the cosmological constant
and the parameters of the Standard Model have only this explanation, since this might be the
truth. Such an explanation is, however, a “last resort”, in that any theory that more speciﬁcally
predicts the observered values, and is otherwise acceptable, should be greatly preferred.
