123 inf and lea in res bol mac
a res bol mac ( 123 ) has a lay of vis uni and a sin lay of hid - den uni wit no hid - to - hid con .
inf in an rbm is muc eas tha
in a gen bol mac and it is als muc eas tha in a cau bel net be - cau the is no exp awa ( 123 ) .
the is the no nee to per any ite to det the act of the hid uni .
the hid sta , j , are con in - dep giv the vis sta , i , and the dis of j is giv by the sta
j = 123 =
123 ex i wij i
con , the hid sta of an rbm are mar dep so it is eas for an rbm to lea pop cod in whi uni may be hig cor .
it is har to do thi in cau bel net wit one hid lay bec the gen mod of a cau bel net ass mar ind .
an rbm can be tra usi the sta bol mac lea alg whi fol a noi but unb est of the gra of the log lik of the dat .
one way to imp thi alg is to sta the net wit a dat vec on the vis uni and the to alt bet upd all of the hid uni in par and upd all of the vis uni in par .
eac upd pic a bin sta for a uni fro its pos dis giv the cur sta of all the uni in the oth set .
if thi alt gib sam is run to equ , the is a ver sim way to upd the wei so as to min the kul - lei div , 123 , bet the dat pro by the rbm ( 123 ) :
123 , and the equ dis of fan ove the vis uni ,
wij / <ij 123 <ij 123
whe < ij > 123 is the exp val of ij whe dat is cla on the vis uni and the hid sta are sam fro the con dis giv the dat , and <ij 123 is the exp val of ij aft pro gib sam .
thi lea rul doe not wor wel bec it can tak a lon tim to app the equ and the sam noi in the est of < ij> 123 can swa the gra .

123 app rbm to fac rec
for ima of fac , bin pix are far fro ide .
a sim way to inc the rep - res pow wit cha the inf and lea pro is to ima tha eac vis uni , i , has 123 rep whi all hav ide wei to the hid uni .
so far as the hid uni are con , it mak no dif whi par rep are tur on : it is onl the num of act rep tha cou .
so a pix can now hav 123 dif int .
dur rec of the ima fro the hid act , all the rep can sha the com of the pro , i , of tur on , and the we can sel rep to be on wit pro 123 i12 123 .
we act app - ed thi bin dis by jus add a lit gau noi to 123 i and rou .
the sam tri can be use for the hid uni .
123 is una exc tha i and j are now the num of act rep .
the rep tri can be int as a che way of sim an ens of neu by ass the hav ide wei .
alt , it can be see as a way of sim a sin neu ove a tim int in whi it may pro mul spi tha con a rat - cod .
for thi rea we cal the mod rbm .
we ass tha the vis uni can pro up to 123 spi and the hid uni can pro up to 123 spi .
we als mad two fur app : we rep i and j in eq .
123 by the exp val and we use the exp val of i whe com the pro of act of the hid uni .
how , we con to use the sto cho int rin rat of the hid uni whe com the one - ste rec of the dat , so the hid act can tra an unb amo of inf fro the dat to the
a sim way to use rbm for fac rec is to tra a sin mod on the tra set , and ide a fac by ndi the gal ima tha pro a hid act vec tha is mos sim to the one pro by the fac .
thi is how eig are use for rec , but it doe not wor wel bec it doe not tak int acc the fac tha som var acr fac are imp for rec , whi som var are not .
to cor thi , we ins tra an rbm mod on pai of dif ima of the sam ind , and the we use thi mod of pai to dec whi gal ima is bes pai wit the tes ima .
to acc for the fac tha the mod lik som ind fac ima mor tha oth , we den the t bet two fac f 123 and f12 as gf1 f12 gf1 f12 gf1 f12 gf1 f12 whe gv1 v12 is the goo sco of the ima pai v12 v12 und the mod .
the goo sco is the neg fre ene whi is an add fun of the tot inp rec by eac hid uni .
eac hid uni has a set of wei goi to eac ima in the pai , and wei - sha is not use , hen gv1 v12 123 gv1 v12
how , to pre sym , eac pai of ima of the sam ind v12 v12 in the tra set has a rev pai v 123 v12 in the set .
we tra the mod wit 123 hid uni on 123 ima pai ( 123 dis pai ) for 123 ite in bat of 123 , wit a lea rat of 123 : 123 123 123 for the wei , a lea rat of 123 123 for the bia , and a mom of 123 : 123
one adv of eig ove cor is tha onc the tes ima has bee con int a vec of eig act , com of tes and gal ima can be mad in the low - dim spa of eig act rat tha the hig - dim spa of pix int .
