most machine learning researchers perform quantitative experiments to estimate generalization error and compare the performance of different algorithms ( in particular , their proposed algorithm ) .
in order to be able to draw statistically convincing conclusions , it is important to estimate the uncertainty of such estimates .
this paper studies the very commonly used k - fold cross - validation estimator of generalization performance .
the main theorem shows that there exists no universal ( valid under all distributions ) unbiased estimator of the variance of k - fold cross - validation .
the analysis that accompanies this result is based on the eigen - decomposition of the covariance matrix of errors , which has only three different eigenvalues corresponding to three degrees of freedom of the matrix and three components of the total variance .
this analysis helps to better understand the nature of the problem and how it can make naive estimators ( that dont take into account the error correlations due to the overlap between training and test sets ) grossly underestimate variance .
this is conrmed by numerical experiments in which the three components of the variance are compared when the difculty of the learning problem and the number of folds are varied .

in machine learning , the standard measure of accuracy for trained models is the prediction error the expected loss on future examples .
learning algorithms themselves are often com - pared according to their average performance , which is formally dened as the expected value of prediction error ( epe ) over training sets .
when the data distribution is unknown , pe and epe cannot be computed .
if the amount of data is large enough , pe can be estimated by the mean error over a hold - out test set .
the usual variance estimates for means of independent samples can then be computed to derive error bars on the estimated prediction error , and to assess the statistical signicance of differences between
the hold - out technique does not account for the variance with respect to the training set , and may thus be considered inappropriate for the purpose of algorithm comparison ( dietterich , 123 ) .
moreover , it makes an inefcient use of data which forbids its application to small sample sizes

this situation , one rather uses computer intensive resampling methods such as cross - validation or bootstrap to estimate pe or epe .
we focus here on k - fold cross - validation .
while it is known that cross - validation provides an unbiased estimate of epe , it is also known that its variance may be very large ( breiman , 123 ) .
this variance should be estimated to provide faithful condence intervals on pe or epe , and to test the signicance of observed differences between algorithms .
this paper provides theoretical arguments showing the difculty of this estimation .
the difculties of the variance estimation have already been addressed ( dietterich , 123; ko - havi , 123; nadeau and bengio , 123 ) .
some distribution - free bounds on the deviations of cross - validation are available , but they are specic to some locally dened decision rules , such as nearest neighbors ( devroye et al . , 123 ) .
this paper builds upon the work of nadeau and bengio ( 123 ) , which investigated in detail the theoretical and practical merits of several estimators of the variance of cross - validation .
our analysis departs from this work in the sampling procedure dening the cross - validation estimate .
while nadeau and bengio ( 123 ) consider k independent training and test splits , we focus on the standard k - fold cross - validation procedure , where there is no overlap between test sets : each example of the original data set is used once and only once as a test example .
this paper is organized as follows .
section 123 denes the measures of performance for algo - rithms , their estimation by k - fold cross - validation and similar procedures such as delete - m jack - knife .
our theoretical ndings are summarized in sections 123
they are followed in section 123 by experiments illustrating the effect of experimental conditions on the total variance and its decom - position in three components , and conrming the underestimation of variance obtained by the naive estimator commonly used by researchers .
general framework
in machine learning , the performance measure differs according to the experimenters viewpoint .
in applications , we are interested in nding the best algorithm for solving the particular task at hand , specied by one particular training set and some information about the data generating process .
in algorithm evaluation , we want to compare several learning algorithms for different learning tasks , and we care about the sensitivity of the learning algorithm to the choice of training examples .
123 measures of performance
formally , we have a training set d = ( z123 , .
, zn ) , with zi z , independently sampled from an unknown distribution p .
we also have a learning algorithm a , which maps a data set of ( almost ) arbitrary size to a function a : z f .
throughout this paper , we consider symmetric algorithms , i . e .
a is insensitive to the ordering of examples in the training set d .
the discrepancy between the prediction and the observation z is measured by a loss functional l : f z r .
typically , l is the quadratic loss in regression ( l ( f , ( x , y ) ) = ( f ( x ) y ) 123 ) and the misclassication ( 123 , 123 ) - loss in classication ( ( l ( f , ( x , y ) ) = 123 f ( x ) 123=y ) .
let f = a ( d ) be the function returned by algorithm a on the training set d .
in application based evaluation , the goal of learning is usually stated as the minimization of the prediction error , i . e .
the expected loss on future test examples
pe ( d ) = e ( l ( f , z ) ) ,
variance of k - fold cross - validation
where the expectation is taken with respect to z sampled from p . 123
in algorithm based evaluation , we are not really interested in performances on a specic training set; we would like comparisons on a more general basis .
in this context , the lowest level of gen - erality can be stated as training sets of size n sampled from p , and the performance of learning algorithm a can be measured by the expected performance of the functions returned in this situation
epe ( n ) = e ( l ( a ( d ) , z ) ) ,
where the expectation is taken with respect to d sampled from pn and z independently sampled
note that other types of performances measure can be proposed , based for example on parame - ters , or dened by the predictability in other frameworks , such as the prequential analysis ( dawid ,
when the data distribution is unknown , pe and epe cannot be computed .
they have to be
estimated , and it is often crucial to assess the uncertainty attached to this estimation :
in application - oriented experiments , to give a condence interval on pe;
in algorithm - oriented experiments , to take into account the stability of a given algorithm .
for comparisons between algorithms , it is essential to assess the statistical signicance of
observed differences in the estimate depe .
although this point is often overlooked , estimating the variance of the estimates cpe and depe re -
123 hold - out estimates of performance
if the amount of data is large enough , pe can be estimated by the mean error over a hold - out test set , and the usual variance estimate for means of independent variables can then be computed .
however , even in the ideal situation where several independent training and test sets would be available , this
estimate should not be applied to compute the variance of depe : even though training and test
examples are independent , the test errors are correlated , since many test errors are computed for each training set , now considered as a random variable .
figure 123 illustrates how crucial it is to take these correlations into account .

the variance of depe ( n ) ( estimated bq 123 , the variance estimator ignoring correlations , shows that this estimate is highly biased , even for large sample sizes , whereas the variance estimator bq 123 , taking into account correlations , is unbiased .
the details of this experiment are given below .

looking at figure 123 suggests that asymptotically the naive estimator of variance converges to the true variance .
this can be shown formally by taking advantage of the results in this paper , as long as the learning algorithm converges as the amount of training data goes to innity ( i . e .
as the function a ( d ) obtained does not depend on the particular training set d ) .
in that limit , the correlations between test errors converge to 123
the rate of convergence will depend on the stability of the learning algorithm as well as on the nature of the data distribution ( e . g . , the presence of thick tails and outliers will slow down convergence ) .
the hold - out technique makes an inefcient use of data which forbids its application in most real - life applications with small samples .
then , k - fold cross - validation can provide estimates of pe
123 k - fold cross - validation estimates of performance
cross - validation is a computer intensive technique , using all available examples as training and test examples .
it mimics the use of training and test sets by repeatedly training the algorithm k times with a fraction 123 / k of training examples left out for testing purposes .
this kind of hold - out estimate of performance lacks computational efciency due to the repeated training , but the latter are meant to lower the variance of the estimate ( stone , 123 ) .
thep123 / d factor provides an r123 of approximately 123 / 123
variance of k - fold cross - validation
in practice , the data set d is rst chunked into k disjoint subsets ( or blocks ) of the same size123 = n / k .
let us write tk for the k - th such block , and dk the training set obtained by removing the elements in tk from d .
the cross - validation estimator is dened as the average of the errors on test block tk obtained when the training set is deprived from tk :
does cv estimate pe or epe ? such a question may seem pointless considering that pe ( d ) is an estimate of epe ( n ) , but it becomes relevant when considering the variance of cv : does it inform us of the uncertainty about pe or epe ?
on the one hand , only one training set , d , enters the denition of cv , which can be , up to an approximation , an unbiased estimate of pe ( d ) ( hastie and tibshirani , 123 ) . 123 some distribution - free bounds on the expected deviations of |cv ( d ) pe ( d ) | are available for leave - one - out cross - validation applied to specic algorithms a such as nearest neighbors ( devroye et al . , 123 ) .
in a more general context , it has also been proved that , under suitable stability assumptions on the algorithm a , cv ( d ) estimates pe ( d ) at least as accurately as the training error ( kearns and ron , 123; anthony and holden , 123 ) .
a more appealing result states that cv is a more accurate estimate of pe than hold - out testing ( blum et al . , 123 ) .
however , this statement does not apply to pe ( d ) , but to the prediction error of a randomized algorithm picking solutions uniformly within
on the other hand , cv is explicitly dened from the learning algorithm a , and not from the function f = a ( d ) .
the inner average in the denition of cv ( 123 ) is an average test loss for a ( dk ) which thus estimates unbiasedly pe ( dk ) .
the training sets d123 , .
, dk are clearly not independent , but they are sampled from pnm .
hence , the outer average of ( 123 ) estimates unbiasedly epe ( n m ) . 123 here , following dietterich ( 123 ) and nadeau and bengio ( 123 ) , we will adopt this latter point of
the variance estimate of depe provided by the hold - out estimate has to account for test error
dependencies due to the choice of training set , which cannot be estimated using a single training / test experiment .
here , the situation is more complex , since there are additional dependencies due to the overlapping training sets d123 , .
before describing this situation in detail and summarizing the results of our theoretical analysis in sections 123 , we detail some procedures similar to k - fold cross - validation , for which the forthcoming analysis will also hold .
123 other estimates of the k - fold cross - validation type
one of the main use of variance estimates of depe is to compare learning algorithms .
the analysis
presented in this paper also applies to the version of cross - validation dedicated to this purpose : if we want to compare the performances of algorithms a123 and a123 , cross - validation with matched pairs
to simplify the analysis below we assume that n is a multiple of k .
more precisely , following hastie and tibshirani ( 123 ) , when l is the quadratic loss , and writing f = a ( d ) , f k = k=123 f k ( xi ) f ( xi ) ( which is weaker than f k f ) yields e ( cv )
a ( dk ) , assuming that for ( xi , yi ) = zi tk , 123
i=123 ( f ( xi ) yi ) 123 ) , where the expectation is taken with respect to y123 ,
note that leave - one - out cross - validation is known to fail to estimate epe for unsmooth statistics ( e . g .
breiman , 123; efron and tibshirani , 123 ) .
this failure is due to the similarity of the training sets d123 , .
, dk which are far from being representative samples drawn from pnm .
bengio and grandvalet
should be the method of choice
d cv ( d ) =
compared to the difference of two independent cross - validation estimates , d cv avoids the addi - tional variability due to train / test splits .
in application oriented experiments , we would like to estimate pe ( d ) , the expected error when training with the given d .
we have seen in section 123 that under stability assumptions , cv can be used to estimate pe .
alternatively , we may resort to the jackknife or the delete - m jackknife ( see e . g .
efron and tibshirani ( 123 ) ) to estimate the optimism ( i . e .
the bias of the mean error on training examples , when the latter is used to estimate pe ( d ) ) .
ideally , the estimate of optimism should be an average over all subsets of size n m , but a less computationally intensive alternative is
the link with cross - validation is exhibited more clearly by the following expression of the ( de -
biased ) jackknife estimate of pe
jk = cv +
( l ( a ( d ) , zi ) l ( a ( dk ) , zi ) ) .
for additional information about jackknife estimates and clues on the derivation of ( 123 ) and ( 123 ) , the reader is referred to efron and tibshirani ( 123 ) .
123 generic notations this paper studies the variance of statistics such as cv , d cv or jk .
in what follows , these statistics will be denoted by , a generic notation for means of observations ei split in k groups .
where , slightly abusing notation , i tk means zi tk and
i tk , ei =

thus , it asymptoti - cally converges to a normally distributed variable , which is completely characterized by its expec - tation e ( ) and its variance var ( ) = e ( 123 ) e ( ) 123
variance of k - fold cross - validation
structure of the covariance matrix
the variance of is dened as follows
cov ( ei , e j ) ,
where cov ( ei , e j ) = e ( eie j ) e ( ei ) e ( e j ) is the covariance between variables ei and e j .
by using symmetry arguments over permutations of the examples in d , we show that many distributions on ei and pairwise joint distributions on ( ei , e j ) are identical .
as a result , the covariance matrix s has a very particular block structure , with only three possible values for s i j = cov ( ei , e j ) , and the expression of q
is thus a linear combination of these three values .
lemma 123 using the notation introduced in section 123 ,
all ei are identically distributed :
there exists f such that , i , p ( ei = u ) = f ( u ) .
all pairs ( ei , e j ) belonging to the same test block are jointly identically distributed :
there exists g such that , ( i , j ) t 123
k : j 123= i , p ( ei = u , e j = v ) = g ( u , v ) .
all pairs ( ei , e j ) belonging to different test blocks are jointly identically distributed :
there exists h such that , i tk , j t` : ` 123= k , p ( ei = u , e j = v ) = h ( u , v ) .
these results are derived immediately from the permutation - invariance of p ( d ) and the symmetry
invariance with respect to permutations within test blocks :

corollary 123 the covariance matrix s of cross - validation errors e = ( e123 , .
, en ) 123 has the simple block structure depicted in figure 123 :
all diagonal elements are identical
i , cov ( ei , ei ) = var ( ei ) = s 123;
all the off - diagonal entries of the k m m diagonal blocks are identical
( i , j ) t 123

all the remaining entries are identical

corollary 123 the variance of the cross - validation estimator is a linear combination of three mo -
cov ( ei , e j )
hence , the problem of estimating q does not involve estimating n ( n + 123 ) / 123 covariances , but it cannot be reduced to that of estimating a single variance parameter .
three components intervene , which may be interpreted as follows when is the k - fold cross - validation estimate of epe :
the variance s 123 is the average ( taken over training sets ) variance of errors for true test
examples when algorithm a is fed with training sets of size m ( k 123 ) .
the within - block covariance w would also apply to true test examples; it arises from the
dependence of test errors stemming from the common training set .
the between - blocks covariance g
is due to the dependence of training sets ( which share n ( k
123 ) / k examples ) and the fact that test block tk appears in all the training sets d` for ` 123= k .
the forthcoming section makes use of this structure to show that there is no universal unbiased estimator of q
variance of k - fold cross - validation
no unbiased estimator of var ( ) exists consider a generic estimator q ( e123 , e123 , .
, en ) 123
let us assume that q its taylor expansion
that depends on the sequence of cross - validation errors e = is an analytic function of the errors , so that we can write
q = a 123 + ( cid : 123 )
a 123 ( i ) ei + ( cid : 123 )
a 123 ( i , j ) eie j + ( cid : 123 )
a 123 ( i , j , k ) eie jek +
we rst show that for unbiased variance estimates ( i . e .
e ( q ) = var ( ) ) , all the a vanish except for the second order coefcients a 123 , i , j .

lemma 123 there is no universal unbiased estimator of var ( ) that involves the ei in a non - quadratic take the expected value of q expressed as in ( 123 ) , and equate it with var ( ) ( 123 ) :

s 123 + m123
a 123 ( i , j ) e ( eie j ) + ( cid : 123 )
a 123 ( i , j , k ) e ( eie jek ) +
for all possible values of the moments of e , one must have a 123 = 123 because q has no such constant term , not depending on any of the moments of e .
similarly , a 123 ( ) must be zero because q has no term in e ( ei ) = .
finally , the third and higher order coefcients a ` ( .
. ) , ` > 123 must also be zero because q has only quantities depending on the second order moments s 123 , w and
since estimators that include moments other than the second moments in their expectation are
biased , we now focus on the class of estimators which are quadratic forms of the errors , i . e .
q = e123we = ( cid : 123 )

lemma 123 the expectation of quadratic estimators q dened as in ( 123 ) is a linear combination of only three terms
e ( q ) = a ( s 123 + 123 ) + b ( w + 123 ) + c ( g + 123 ) ,
where ( a , b , c ) are dened as follows :

which is recognized as the expectation of the estimator dened in equation ( 123 ) .
we now use lemma 123 to prove that there is no universally unbiased estimator of var ( ) , i . e .
there is no estimator q such that e ( q ) = var ( ) for all possible distributions of e .
theorem 123 there exists no universally unbiased estimator of var ( ) .
because of lemma 123 and 123 , it is enough to prove the result for estimators that are quadratic forms expressed as in equation ( 123 ) .
to obtain unbiasedness , the expected value of that estimator must be equated with var ( ) ( 123 ) :
a ( s 123 + 123 ) + b ( w + 123 ) + c ( g + 123 ) =
for this equality to be satised for all distributions of cross - validation errors , it must be satised for all admissible values of , s 123 , w , and g .
this imposes the following unsatisable constraints on ( a , b , c ) :
a + b + c = 123
variance of k - fold cross - validation
eigenanalysis of the covariance matrix
one way to gain insight on the origin of the negative statement of theorem 123 is via the eigenanalysis , the covariance of e .
this decomposition can be performed analytically thanks to the very particular block structure displayed in figure 123
lemma 123 let vk be the binary vector indicating the membership of each example to test block k .
the eigensystem of s
is as follows :
l 123 = s 123 w with multiplicity n k and eigenspace dened by the orthogonal of basis
l 123 = s 123 + ( m 123 ) w mg with multiplicity k 123 and eigenspace dened in the orthogonal of
123 by the basis ( vk ) k
l 123 = s 123 + ( m 123 ) w + ( n m ) g with eigenvector 123
from corollary 123 , the covariance matrix s = e ( ee123 ) e ( e ) e ( e ) 123 can be decomposed as
s = ( s 123 w ) s 123 + m ( w g ) s 123 + ng
where s 123 = i , s 123 = 123
m ( v123 .
. vk ) ( v123 .
. vk ) 123 and s 123 = 123
s 123 , s 123 and s 123 share the same eigenvectors , with eigenvalues being equal either to zero or one : the eigenvector 123 has eigenvalue 123 for s 123 , s 123 and s 123;
the eigenspace dened in the orthogonal of 123 by the basis ( vk ) k
with eigenvalues 123 for s 123 and s 123 and 123 for s 123;
k=123 denes k 123 eigenvectors
all remaining eigenvectors have eigenvalues 123 for s 123 and 123 for s 123 and s 123
lemma 123 states that the vector e can be decomposed into three uncorrelated parts : n k projec - tions to the subspace orthogonal to ( vk ) k the orthogonal of 123 , and one projection on 123
a single vector example with n independent elements can be seen as n independent examples .
similarly , these projections of e can be equivalently repre - sented by respectively n k , k 123 and one uncorrelated one - dimensional examples , corresponding to the coordinates of e in these subspaces .
k=123 , k 123 projections to the subspace spanned by ( vk ) k
n123 is precisely .
hence there is no unbiased estimate of var ( ) =
in particular , for the projection on 123 , with only a single one - dimensional point , the sample variance is null , resulting in the absence of an unbiased variance estimator of l 123
the projection of e on the eigenvector 123 we have only one realization of the vector e .
for the same reason , even with simple parametric assumptions on e ( such as e gaussian ) , the maximum likelihood estimate of q is not dened .
only l 123 and l 123 can be estimated unbiasedly .
note that this problem cannot be addressed by performing multiple k - fold splits of the data set .
such a procedure would not provide independent realizations
bengio and grandvalet
possible values for w and g theorem 123 states that no estimator is unbiased , and in its demonstration , it is shown that the bias of any quadratic estimator is a linear combination of 123 , s 123 , w and g .
regarding estimation , it is thus interesting to see what constraints restrict the possible range of these quantities .
lemma 123 for = cv and = d cv , the following inequalities hold :
nm ( s 123 + ( m 123 ) w ) g 123 the shape of the admissible ( w displayed in figure 123

the constraints on w
result from the cauchy - schwartz inequality which provides cov ( u , v ) 123
s 123 w s 123
moreover , the following reasoning shows that , for = cv and = d cv , w the covariance of ( differences in ) test errors for training sets of size n m and test sets of size ` = m .

the constraints on g simply rephrase that the eigenvalues l 123 and l 123 of the covariance matrix s

the simpler ( and looser ) form is obtained by using w s 123
the admissible ( w
, g ) region obtained in lemma 123 is very large .
furthermore , there is no con - straint linking and s 123 , the mean and variance of ei .
hence we cannot propose a variance estimate with universally small bias .
and g .
the admissible values provided in the preceding section suggest that w
we already mentioned that the bias of any quadratic estimator is a linear combination of 123 , s 123 , and g cannot be proved to be negligible compared to s 123
this section illustrates that in practice , the contribution to the variance of due to w ( see equation ( 123 ) ) can be of same order than the one due s 123
it therefore suggests that the estimators of q should indeed take into account the correlations of ei .
experiment 123 true variance of k - fold cross - validation .
we repeat the experimental setup of experiment 123 , except that now , we are in the more realistic situation where only one sample of size n is available .
since cross - validation is known to be sensitive to the instability of algorithms , in addition to this standard setup , we also consider another one with
the input xi = ( xi123 , .
, xid ) 123 is still 123 - dimensional , but it is now a mixture of two centered gaussian variables : let ti be a binary variable , with p ( ti = 123 ) = p = 123; when ti = 123 , xi n ( 123 , i ) ; i n ( 123 , 123 / ( p +

we now look at the variance of k - fold cross - validation ( k = 123 ) , and decompose in the three
orthogonal components s 123 , w
and g .
the results are shown in figure 123
when there are no outliers , the contribution of g
is very important for small sample sizes .
for large sample sizes , the overall variance is considerably reduced and is mainly caused by s 123
in these situations , the learning algorithm returns very similar answers for all training sets .
when there are outliers , w has little effect , but the contribution of g is of same order as the one of s 123 , even when the ratio of examples to free parameters is large ( here up to 123 ) .
thus , in difcult situations , where a ( d ) varies according to the realization of d , neglecting the effect of w and g can be expected to introduce a bias of the order of the true variance .
in s 123 , w
it is also interesting to see how these quantities are affected by the number of folds k .
the decomposition of q ( 123 ) does not imply that k should be set either to n or to 123 ( according to the sign of w g ) in order to minimize the variance of .
modifying k affects s 123 , w through the size and overlaps of the training sets d123 , .
, dk , as illustrated in figure 123
for a xed sample size , the variance of and the contribution of s 123 , w and g effects varies smoothly with k . 123 the experiments with and without outliers illustrate that there is no general trend either in
of course , the mean of is also affected in the process .

we also report an experiment illustrating that the previous observations also apply to classi - cation on real data .
the variance of k - fold cross - validation ( k = 123 ) , decomposed in the three orthogonal components s 123 , w experiment 123 classication with trees on the letter data set .
is displayed in figure 123
the letter data set comprises 123 , 123 examples described by 123 numeric features .
the original setup considers 123 categories reprensenting the letters of the roman alphabet .
here , we used a simplied setup with 123 classes ( a to m ) vs .
( n to z ) in order to obtain sensible results for small
accurate estimates of s 123 , w
require many independent training samples .
this was achieved by considering the set of 123 , 123 examples to be the population , from which independent training samples were drawn by uniform sampling with replacement .
here again , the variance of cv is mainly due to s 123 and g .
according to the number of training examples , s 123 is only responsible for 123 to 123 % of the total variance , so that a variance estimate based solely on s 123 has a negative bias of the order of magnitude of the variance itself .

special cases
this section addresses how our main result can be transposed to hold - out estimates of generalization error .
we also detail how it applies to two specic instances of the general k - fold cross - validation scheme : two - fold and leave - one - out cross validation .
123 hold - out estimate of epe
when having k independent training and test sets , the structure of hold - out errors resemble the one of cross - validation errors , except that we know ( from the independence of training and test sets ) that
this knowledge allows to build the unbiased variance estimate bq 123 described in 123 .
this can
be seen directly in the proof of theorem 123 : knowing that g = 123 removes the third equation in the linear system ( 123 ) .
in practice , one is often restricted to k = 123 ( ordinary hold - out test ) , which allows to estimate the variance due to the nite test set but not due to the particular choice of training set .
123 two - fold cross - validation
two - fold cross - validation has been advocated to perform hypothesis testing ( dietterich , 123; al - paydin , 123 ) .
it is a special case of k - fold cross - validation since the training blocks are mutually independent since they do not overlap .
however , this independence does not modify the structure of e in the sense that g is not null .
the between - block correlation stems from the fact that the training block d123 is the test block t123 and vice - versa .
123 leave - one - out cross - validation
leave - one - out cross - validation is a particular case of k - fold cross - validation , where k = n .
the structure of the covariance matrix is simplied , without diagonal blocks : s = ( s 123 g ) s 123 +ng estimation difculties however remain : even in this particular case , there is no unbiased estimate of variance .
from the denition of b ( lemma 123 ) , we have b = 123 , and with m = 123 the linear system ( 123 )
a + c = 123 ,

which still admits no solution .
it is known that k - fold cross - validation may suffer from high variability , which can be responsible for bad choices in model selection and erratic behavior in the estimated expected prediction error .
in this paper , we show that estimating the variance of k - fold cross - validation is difcult .
esti - mating a variance can be done from independent realizations or from dependent realizations whose correlation is known .
k - fold cross - validation produces dependent test errors .
our analysis shows that although the correlations are structured in a very simple manner , their values cannot be esti - mated unbiasedly .
consequently , there is no unbiased estimator of the variance of k - fold cross -
our experimental section shows that in very simple cases , the bias incurred by ignoring the dependencies between test errors will be of the order of the variance itself .
these experiments illustrate thus that the assessment of the signicance of observed differences in cross - validation scores should be treated with much caution .
the problem being unveiled , the next step of this study consists in building and comparing variance estimators dedicated to the very specic structure of the test error dependencies .
