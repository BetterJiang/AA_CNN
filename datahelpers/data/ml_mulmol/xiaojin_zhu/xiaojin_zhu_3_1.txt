we study the empirical strategies that humans follow as they teach a target concept with a simple 123d threshold to a robot . 123 previous studies of computational teach - ing , particularly the teaching dimension model and the curriculum learning prin - ciple , offer contradictory predictions on what optimal strategy the teacher should follow in this teaching task .
we show through behavioral studies that humans em - ploy three distinct teaching strategies , one of which is consistent with the curricu - lum learning principle , and propose a novel theoretical framework as a potential explanation for this strategy .
this framework , which assumes a teaching goal of minimizing the learners expected generalization error at each iteration , extends the standard teaching dimension model and offers a theoretical justication for
with machine learning comes the question of how to effectively teach .
computational teaching has been well studied in the machine learning community ( 123 , 123 , 123 , 123 , 123 , 123 , 123 , 123 , 123 , 123 , 123 ) .
however , whether these models can predict how humans teach is less clear .
the latter question is important not only for such areas as education and cognitive psychology but also for applications of machine learning , as learning agents such as robots become commonplace and learn from humans .
a better understanding of the teaching strategies that humans follow might inspire the development of new machine learning models and the design of learning agents that more naturally accommodate
studies of computational teaching have followed two prominent threads .
the rst thread , devel - oped by the computational learning theory community , is exemplied by the teaching dimension model ( 123 ) and its extensions ( 123 , 123 , 123 , 123 , 123 , 123 , 123 ) .
the second thread , motivated partly by ob - servations in psychology ( 123 ) , is exemplied by the curriculum learning principle ( 123 , 123 , 123 ) .
we will discuss these two threads in the next section .
however , they make conicting predictions on what optimal strategy a teacher should follow in a simple teaching task .
this conict serves as an opportunity to compare these predictions to human teaching strategies in the same task .
this paper makes two main contributions : ( i ) it enriches our empirical understanding of human teaching and ( ii ) it offers a theoretical explanation for a particular teaching strategy humans follow .
our approach combines cognitive psychology and machine learning .
we rst conduct a behavioral study with human participants in which participants teach a robot , following teaching strategies of their choice .
this approach differs from most previous studies of computational teaching in machine learning and psychology that involve a predetermined teaching strategy and that focus on the behavior of the learner rather than the teacher .
we then compare the observed human teaching strategies to those predicted by the teaching dimension model and the curriculum learning principle .

figure 123 : the target concept hj .
empirical results indicate that human teachers follow the curriculum learning principle , while no evidence of the teaching dimension model is observed .
finally , we provide a novel theoretical analysis that extends recent ideas in teaching dimension model ( 123 , 123 ) and offers curriculum learning a rigorous underpinning .
123 competing models of teaching we rst review the classic teaching dimension model ( 123 , 123 ) .
let x be an input space , y the label space , and ( x123 , y123 ) , .
, ( xn , yn ) x y a set of instances .
we focus on binary classication in the unit interval : x = ( 123 , 123 ) , y = ( 123 , 123 ) .
we call h 123 ( x123 , . . . , xn ) a concept class and h h a concept .
a concept h is consistent with instance ( x , y ) iff x h y = 123
h is consistent with a set of instances if it is consistent with every instance in the set .
a set of instances is called a teaching set of a concept h with respect to h , if h is the only concept in h that is consistent with the set .
the teaching dimension of h with respect to h is the minimum size of its teaching set .
the teaching dimension of h is the maximum teaching dimension of its concepts .
consider the task in figure 123 , which we will use throughout the paper .
let x123 .
let h be all threshold labelings : h = ( h | ( 123 , 123 ) , i = 123 .
n : xi h xi ) .
the target concept hj has the threshold between xj and xj+123 : hj = ( xj+123 , .
then , the teaching dimension of most hj is 123 , as one needs the minimum teaching set ( ( xj , 123 ) , ( xj+123 , 123 ) ) ; for the special cases h123 = ( x123 , .
, xn ) and hn = the teaching dimension is 123 with the teaching set ( ( x123 , 123 ) ) and ( ( xn , 123 ) ) , respectively .
the teaching dimension of h is 123
for our purpose , the most important argument is the following : the teaching strategy for most hjs suggested by teaching dimension is to show two instances ( ( xj , 123 ) , ( xj+123 , 123 ) ) closest to the decision boundary .
intuitively , these are the instances most confusable by the learner .
alternatively , curriculum learning suggests an easy - to - hard ( or clear - to - ambiguous ) teaching strat - egy ( 123 ) .
for the target concept in figure 123 , easy instances are those farthest from the de - cision boundary in each class , while hard ones are the closest to the boundary .
one such teaching strategy is to present instances from alternating classes , e . g . , in the following order : ( x123 , 123 ) , ( xn , 123 ) , ( x123 , 123 ) , ( xn123 , 123 ) , .
, ( xj , 123 ) , ( xj+123 , 123 ) .
such a strategy has been used for second - language teaching in humans .
for example , to train japanese listeners on the english ( r ) - ( l ) distinc - tion , mccandliss et al .
linearly interpolated a vocal tract model to create a 123d continuum similar to figure 123 along ( r ) and ( l ) sounds .
they showed that participants were better able to distinguish the two phonemes if they were given easy ( over - articulated ) training instances rst ( 123 ) .
compu - tationally , curriculum learning has been justied as a heuristic related to continuation method in optimization to avoid poor local optima ( 123 ) .
hence , for the task in figure 123 , we have two sharply contrasting teaching strategies at hand : the boundary strategy starts near the decision boundary , while the extreme strategy starts with ex - treme instances and gradually approaches the decision boundary from both sides .
our goal in this paper is to compare human teaching strategies with these two predictions to shed more light on models of teaching .
while the teaching task used in our exploration is simple , as most real - world teaching situations do not involve a threshold in a 123d space , we believe that it is important to lay the foundation in a tractable task before studying more complex tasks .
123 a human teaching behavioral study
under irb approval , we conducted a behavioral study with human participants to explore human teaching behaviors in a task similar to that illustrated in figure 123
in our study , participants teach the target concept of graspabilitywhether an object can be grasped and picked up with one handto a robot .
we chose graspability because it corresponds nicely to a 123d space empirically
figure 123 : ( a ) a participant performing the card sorting / labeling and teaching tasks .
teaching sequences that follow the extreme strategy gradually shrink the version space v123
studied before ( 123 ) .
we chose to use a robot learner because it offers great control and consistency while facilitating natural interaction and teaching .
the robot keeps its behavior consistent across conditions and trials , therefore , providing us with the ability to isolate various interactional factors .
this level of experimental control is hard to achieve with a human learner .
the robot also affords embodied behavioral cues that facilitate natural interaction and teaching strategies that computers do not afford .
participants were 123 paid subjects recruited from the university of wisconsinmadison campus .
all were native english speakers with an average age of 123 years .
materials .
we used black - and - white photos of n = 123 objects chosen from the norming study of salmon et al .
the photos were of common objects ( e . g . , food , furniture , animals ) whose average subjective graspability ratings evenly span the whole range .
we printed each photo on a 123 - by - 123 inch card .
the robot was a wakamaru humanlike robot manufactured by mitsubishi heavy industries , ltd .
it neither learned nor responded to teaching .
instead , it was programmed to follow motion in the room with its gaze .
though seemingly senseless , this behavior in fact provides a consistent experience to the participants without extraneous factors to bias them .
it also corresponds to the no - feedback assumption in most teaching models ( 123 ) .
participants were not informed that the robot was not actually learning .
procedure .
each participant completed the experiment alone .
the experiment involved two sub - tasks that were further broken down into multiple steps .
in the rst subtask , participants sorted the objects based on their subjective ratings of their graspability following the steps below .
in step 123 , participants were instructed to place each object along a ruler provided on a long table as seen in figure 123 ( a ) .
to provide baselines on the two ends of the graspability spectrum , we xed a highly graspable object ( a toothbrush ) and a highly non - graspable object ( a building ) on the two ends of the ruler .
we captured the image of the table and later converted the position of each card into a participant - specic , continuous graspability rating x123 , .
, xn ( 123 , 123 ) .
for our purpose , there is no need to enforce inter - participant agreement .
in step 123 , participants assigned a binary graspable ( y = 123 ) or not graspable ( y = 123 ) label to each object by writing the label on the back of the corresponding card .
this gave us labels y123 , .
the sorted cards and the decision boundary from one of the participants is illustrated in figure 123
in step 123 , we asked participants to leave the room for a short duration so that the robot could examine the sorted cards on the table without looking at the labels provided at the back , creating the impression that the learner will associate the cards with the corresponding values x123 , .
in the second subtask , participants taught the robot the ( binary ) concept of graspability using the cards .
in this task , participants picked up a card from the table , turned toward the robot , and held the card up while providing a verbal description of the objects graspability ( i . e . , the binary label y ) as seen in figure 123 ( a ) .
the two cards , toothbrush and building , were xed to the table and not available for teaching .
the participants were randomly assigned into two conditions : ( 123 ) natural and ( 123 ) constrained .
in the natural condition , participants were allowed to use natural language to describe the graspability of the objects , while those in the constrained condition were only allowed
123 . 123 . 123 . 123 . 123iteration t|v123| to say either graspable or not graspable .
they were instructed to use as few cards as they felt necessary .
there was no time limit on either subtasks .
results .
the teaching sequences from all participants are presented in figure 123
the title of each plot contains the participant id and condition .
the participants rating and classication of all objects are presented above the x - axis .
objects labeled as not graspable are indicated with blue circles and those labeled as graspable are marked with red plus signs .
the x - axis position of the object represents its rating x ( 123 , 123 ) .
the vertical blue and red lines denote an ambiguous region around the decision boundary; objects to the left of the blue line have the label not graspable; those to the right of the red line are labeled as graspable , and objects between these lines could have labels in mixed order .
in theory , following the boundary strategy , the teacher should start with teaching instances on these two lines as suggested by the teaching dimension model .
the y - axis is trial t = 123 , .
, 123 , which progresses upwards .
the black line and dots represent the participants teaching sequence .
for example , participant p123 started teaching at t = 123 with an object she rated as x = 123 and labeled as graspable; at t = 123 , she chose an example with rating x = 123 and label not graspable; and so on .
the average teaching sequence had approximately 123 examples , while the longest teaching sequence had a length of 123 examples .
we observed three major human teaching strategies in our data : ( 123 ) the extreme strategy , which starts with objects with extreme ratings and gradually moves toward the decision boundary; ( 123 ) the linear strategy , which follows a prominent left - to - right or right - to - left sequence; and ( 123 ) the positive - only strategy , which involves only positively labeled examples .
we categorized most teaching sequences into these three strategies following a simple heuristic .
first , sequences that involved only positive examples were assigned to the positive - only strategy .
then , we assigned the sequences whose rst two teaching examples had different labels to the extreme strategy and the others to the linear strategy .
while this simplistic approach does not guarantee perfect clas - sication ( e . g . , p123 can be labeled differently ) , it minimizes hand - tuning and reduces the risk of overtting .
we made two exceptions , manually assigning p123 and p123 to the extreme strategy .
nonetheless , these few potential misclassications do not change our conclusions below .
none of the sequences followed the boundary strategy .
in fact , among all 123 participants , 123 started teaching with the most graspable object ( according to their own rating ) , 123 with the least graspable , none in or around the ambiguous region ( as boundary strategy would predict ) , and 123 with some other objects .
in brief , people showed a tendency to start teaching with extreme objects , especially the most graspable ones .
during post - interview , when asked why they did not start with objects around their decision boundary , most participants mentioned that they wanted to start with clear examples of graspability .
for participants who followed the extreme strategy , we are interested in whether their teaching sequences approach the decision boundary as curriculum learning predicts .
specically , at any time t , let the partial teaching sequence be ( x123 , y123 ) , .
, ( xt , yt ) .
the aforementioned ambiguous region with respect to this partial sequence is the interval between the inner - most pair of teaching examples with different labels .
this can be written as v123 ( maxj : yj =123 xj , minj : yj =123 xj ) where j is over 123 .
v123 is exactly the version space of consistent threshold hypotheses ( the subscript 123 will become clear in the next section ) .
figure 123 ( b ) shows a box plot of the size of v123 for all participants as a function of t .
the red lines mark the median and the blue boxes indicate the 123st & 123rd quartiles .
as expected , the size of the version space decreases .
figure 123 : sorted cards and the decision boundary from one of the participants .
the extreme strategy
the linear strategy
the positive - only strategy
figure 123 : teaching sequences of all participants .
finally , the positive - only strategy was observed signicantly more in the natural condition ( 123 / 123 123% ) than in the constrained condition ( 123 / 123 = 123% ) , 123 ( 123 , n = 123 ) = 123 , p = . 123
we observed that these participants elaborated in english to the robot why they thought that their objects were graspable .
we speculate that they might have felt that they had successfully described the rules and that there was no need to use negative examples .
in contrast , the constrained condition did not have the rich expressivity of natural language , necessitating the use of negative examples .
123 a theoretical account of the extreme teaching strategy
we build on our empirical results and offer a theoretical analysis as a possible rationalization for the extreme strategy .
research in cognitive psychology has consistently shown that humans represent everyday objects with a large number of features ( e . g . , ( 123 , 123 ) ) .
we posit that although our teaching task was designed to mimic the one - dimensional task illustrated in figure 123 ( e . g . , the linear layout of the cards in figure 123 ) , our teachers might still have believed ( perhaps subconsciously ) that the robot learner , like humans , associates each teaching object with multiple feature dimensions .
under the high - dimensional assumption , we show that the extreme strategy is an outcome of mini - mizing per - iteration expected error of the learner .
note that the classic teaching dimension model ( 123 ) fails to predict the extreme strategy even under this assumption .
our analysis is inspired by recent advances in teaching dimension , which assume that teaching progresses in iterations and learning is to be maximized after each iteration ( 123 , 123 ) .
different from those analysis , we minimize the expected error instead of the worst - case error and employ different techniques .
123 problem setting and model assumptions our formal set up is as follows .
the instance space is the d - dimensional hypercube x = ( 123 , 123 ) d .
we use boldface x x to denote an instance and xij for the j - th dimension of instance xi .
the binary label y is determined by the threshold 123 123 ) .
this formulation idealizes our empirical study where the continuous rating is the rst dimension .
it implies that the target concept is unrelated to any of the other d123 features .
in practice , however , there may be other
123 in the rst dimension : yi = 123 ( xi123 123
123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , constrained123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural123xtp123 , natural features that are correlated with the target concept .
but our analysis carries through by replacing d with the number of irrelevant dimensions .
departing from classic teaching models , we consider a pool - based sequential teaching setting .
in this setting , a pool of n instances are sampled iid x123 , .
, xn p ( x ) , where we assume that p ( x ) is uniform on x for simplicity .
their labels y123 .
yn may be viewed as being sampled from the conditional distribution p ( yi = 123 | xi ) = 123 ( xi123> 123 123 ) .
the teacher can only sequentially teach instances selected from the pool ( e . g . , in our empirical study , the pool consists of the 123 objects ) .
her goal is for the learner to generalize well on test instances outside the pool ( also sampled from p ( x , y ) = p ( x ) p ( y | x ) ) after each iteration .
at this point , we make two strong assumptions on the learner .
first , we assume that the learner entertains axis - parallel hypotheses .
that is , each hypothesis has the form hks ( x ) = 123 ( s ( xk ) 123 ) for some dimension k ( 123 .
d ) , threshold ( 123 , 123 ) , and orientation s ( 123 , 123 ) .
the cogni - tive interpretation of an axis - parallel hypothesis is that the learner attends to a single dimension at any given time . 123 as in classic teaching models , our learner is consistent ( i . e . , it never contradicts with the teaching instances it receives ) .
the version space v ( t ) of the learner , i . e . , the set of hy - potheses that is consistent with the teaching sequence ( x123 , y123 ) , .
, ( xt , yt ) so far , takes the form k=123vk ( t ) where vk ( t ) = ( hk , 123 | maxj : yj =123 xjk minj : yj =123 xjk ) ( hk , 123 | v ( t ) = d maxj : yj =123 xjk minj : yj =123 xjk ) .
the version space can be thought of as the union of inner intervals surviving the teaching examples .
second , similar to the randomized learners in ( 123 ) , our learner selects a hypothesis h uniformly from the version space v ( t ) , follows it until when h is no longer in v ( t ) , and then randomly selects a replacement hypothesisa strategy known as win stay , lose shift in cognitive psychology ( 123 ) .
it is thus a gibbs classier .
in particular , the risk , dened as the expected 123 - 123 loss of the learner on a test instance , is r ( t ) e ( x , y ) p ( x , y ) ehv ( t ) 123 ( h ( x ) 123=y ) .
we point out that our assumptions are psychologically plausible and will greatly simplify the derivation below .
123 starting with extreme teaching instances is asymptotically optimal
we now show why starting with extreme teaching instances as in curriculum learning , as opposed to the boundary strategy , is optimal under our setting .
specically , we consider the problem of se - lecting an optimal teaching sequence of length t = 123 , one positive and one negative , ( x123 , 123 ) , ( x123 , 123 ) .
introducing the shorthand a x123 , b x123 , the teacher seeks a , b to minimize the risk :
note that we allow a , b to take any value within their domains , which is equivalent to having an innite pool for the teacher to choose from .
we will tighten it later .
also note that we assume the teacher does not pay attention to irrelevant dimensions , whose feature values can then be modeled by uniform random variables .
the version space is |v ( 123 ) | = a b + pd for any teaching sequence of length 123 , the individual intervals of the version space are of size |v123 ( 123 ) | = a b , |vk ( 123 ) | = |x123k x123k| for k = 123 .
d , respectively .
the total size of k=123 |x123k x123k| .
figure 123 ( a ) shows that for all h123 v123 ( 123 ) , the decision boundary is parallel to the true decision boundary and the test error is e ( x , y ) p ( x , y ) 123 ( h123 ( x ) 123=y ) = |123 123 / 123| .
figure 123 ( b ) shows that for all hkks b |123 123 / 123|d123 +pd k=123vk ( 123 ) , the decision boundary is orthogonal to the true decision boundary and the test error is 123 / 123
therefore , we have r ( 123 ) = .
introducing the shorthand ck |x123k .
the intuition is that a pair of teach - ing instances lead to a version space v ( 123 ) consisting of one interval per dimension .
a random hypothesis selected from the interval in the rst dimension v123 ( 123 ) can range from good ( if 123 is close

k=123 ck , one can write r ( 123 ) = ( 123
123 b ) 123 + 123
123a generalization to arbitrary non - axis parallel linear separators is possible in theory and would be interest - ing .
however , non - axis parallel linear separators ( known as information integration in psychology ) are more challenging for human learners .
consequently , our human teachers might not have expected the robot learner to perform information integration either .
figure 123 : ( a ) a hypothesis h123 v123 ( 123 ) is parallel to the true decision boundary , with test error |123 / 123| ( shaded area ) .
( b ) a hypothesis h123s v123 ( 123 ) is orthogonal to the true decision boundary , with test error 123 / 123 ( shaded area ) .
( c ) theoretical teaching sequences gradually shrink |v123| , similar to human behaviors .
to 123 / 123 ) to poor ( 123 far away from 123 / 123 ) , while one selected from d k=123vk ( 123 ) is always bad .
the teacher can optimize the risk by choosing the size of v123 ( t ) related to the total version space size .
the optimal choice is specied by the following theorem .
theorem 123
the minimum risk r ( 123 ) is achieved at a = proof .
first , we show that at the minimum a , b are symmetric around 123 / 123 , i . e . , b = 123 a .
suppose not .
then , ( a+b ) / 123 = 123 / 123+ for some 123= 123
let a123 = a , b123 = b .
then , ( 123 the minimum , a contradiction .
next , substituting b = 123 a in r ( 123 ) and setting the derivative w . r . t .
a to 123 proves the theorem .
recall that c is the size of the part of the version space in irrelevant dimensions .
when d , c and the solution is a = 123 , b = 123
here , the learner can form so many bad hypotheses in the many wrong dimensions that the best strategy for the teacher is to make v123 ( 123 ) as large as possible , even though many hypotheses in v123 ( 123 ) have nonzero error .
corollary 123
the minimizer to ( 123 ) is a = 123 , b = 123 when the dimensionality d .
, b = 123 a .
we characterize the distribution of ck by considering the distance between two random vari - ables x123k , x123k sampled uniformly in ( 123 , 123 ) .
let z ( 123 ) , z ( 123 ) be the values of x123k , x123k sorted in an ascending order .
then ck = z ( 123 ) z ( 123 ) is an instance of order statistics ( 123 ) .
one can show that , in general with t independent unif ( 123 , 123 ) random variables sorted in an ascending order as z ( 123 ) , .
, z ( j ) , z ( j+123 ) , .
, z ( t ) , the distance z ( j+123 ) z ( j ) follows a beta ( 123 , t ) distribution .
in our case with t = 123 , ck beta ( 123 , 123 ) , whose mean is 123 / 123 as expected .
it follows that c is the sum of d 123 independent beta random variables .
as d , c .
let = 123 / c .
applying lhopitals rule , limc a = limc
corollary 123 has an interesting cognitive interpretation; the teacher only needs to pay attention to the relevant ( rst ) dimension x123 , x123 when selecting the two teaching instances .
she does not need to consider the irrelevant dimensions , as those will add up to a large c , which simplies the teachers task in choosing a teaching sequence; she simply picks two extreme instances in the rst dimension .
we also note that in practice d does not need to be very large for a to be close to 123
for example , 123 ( d 123 ) = 123 and the corresponding a = 123 , with with d = 123 dimensions , the average c is 123 d = 123 , a = 123 .
this observation provides further psychological plausibility to our model .
so far , we have assumed an innite pool , such that the teacher can select the extreme teaching instances with x123 = 123 , x123 = 123
in practice , the pool is nite and the optimal a , b values specied in theorem 123 may not be attainable within the pool .
however , it is straightforward to show that limc r123 ( t ) < 123 where the derivative is w . r . t .
a after substituting b = 123 a .
that is , in the case of c , the objective in ( 123 ) is a monotonically decreasing function of a .
therefore , the optimal strategy for a nite pool is to choose the negative instance with the smallest x123 value and
ab123 / 123x123 / 123x123 . 123 . 123 . 123 . 123iteration t|v123| d=123d=123d=123d=123 the positive instance with the largest x123 value .
note the similarity to curriculum learning which starts with extreme ( easy ) instances .
123 the teaching sequence should gradually approach the boundary thus far , we have focused on choosing the rst two teaching instances .
we now show that , as teaching continues , the teacher should choose instances with a and b gradually approaching 123 / 123
this is a direct consequence of minimizing the risk r ( t ) at each iteration , as c decreases to 123
in this section , we study the speed by which c decreases to 123 and a to 123 / 123
the moment when the teacher has already presented a teaching sequence ( x123 , y123 ) , .
, ( xt123 , yt123 ) and is about to select the next pair of teaching instances ( xt123 , 123 ) , ( xt , 123 ) .
teaching with pairs is not crucial but will simplify the analysis .
following the discussion after corol - lary 123 , we assume that the teacher only pays attention to the rst dimension when selecting teaching instances .
this assumption allows us to again model the other dimensions as random variables .
the teacher wishes to determine the optimal a = xt123 , 123 , b = xt , 123 values according to theorem 123
what is the value of c for a teaching sequence of length t ? theorem 123
let the teaching sequence contain t123 negative labels and t t123 positive ones .
then respectively ) and k beta ( 123 , t ) independently for k = 123 .
consequently , e ( c ) = 123 ( d123 )
the random variables ck = kk , where k bernoulli ( cid : 123 ) 123 / ( cid : 123 ) t
( cid : 123 ) , 123 123 / ( cid : 123 ) t
( cid : 123 ) ( cid : 123 ) ( with values 123 , 123
we show that for each irrelevant dimension k = 123 .
d , after t teaching instances , |vk ( t ) | = kk .
as mentioned above , these t teaching instances can be viewed as unif ( 123 , 123 ) random variables in the kth dimension .
sort the values x123k , .
, xtk in ascending order .
denote the sorted values as z ( 123 ) , .
, z ( t ) .
vk ( t ) is non - empty only if the labels happen to be linearly separable , i . e . , either z ( 123 ) .
z ( t123 ) having negative labels while the rest having positive labels or the other way around .
consider the corresponding analogy where one randomly selects a permutation of t items ( there are t ! permutations ) , such that the selected permutation has rst t123 items with negative labels and the rest with positive labels ( there are t123 ! ( t t123 ) ! such permutations ) .
this probability corresponds to k .
when vk ( t ) is nonempty , its size |vk ( t ) | is characterized by the order statistics z ( t123+123 ) z ( t123 ) , which corresponds to the beta random variable k as mentioned earlier in the proof of corollary 123
as the binomial coefcient in the denominator of e ( c ) suggests , c decreases to 123 rapidly with t , because t randomly - placed labels in 123d are increasingly unlikely to be linearly separable .
following theorem 123 , the corresponding optimal a , b approach 123 / 123
due to the form of theorem 123 , the pace is slower .
to illustrate how fast the optimal teaching sequence approaches 123 / 123 in the rst dimension , figure 123 ( c ) shows a plot of |v123| = a b as a function of t by using e ( c ) in theorem 123 ( note in general that this is not e ( |v123| ) , but only a typical value ) .
we set t123 = t / 123
this plot is similar to the one we produced from human behavioral data in figure 123 ( b ) .
for comparison , that plot is copied here in the background .
because the effective number of independent dimensions d is unknown , we present several curves for different ds .
some of these curves provide a qualitatively reasonable t to human behavior , despite the fact that we made several simplifying model assumptions .
123 conclusion and future work
we conducted a human teaching experiment and observed three distinct human teaching strategies .
empirical results yielded no evidence for the boundary strategy but showed that the extreme strategy is consistent with the curriculum learning principle .
we presented a theoretical framework that extends teaching dimension and explains two dening properties of the extreme strategy : ( 123 ) teaching starts with extreme instances and ( 123 ) teaching gradually approaches the decision boundary .
our framework predicts that , in the absence of irrelevant dimensions ( d = 123 ) , teaching should start at the decision boundary .
to verify this prediction , in our future work , we plan to conduct additional human teaching studies where the objects have no irrelevant attributes .
we also plan to further investigate and explain the linear strategy and the positive - only strategy that we observed in our current study .
