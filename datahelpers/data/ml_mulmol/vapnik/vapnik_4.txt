according to the classical bernoulli theorem , the relative frequency of an event a in a sequence of independent trials converges ( in probability ) to the probability of that event .
in many applications , however , the need arises to judge simultaneously the probabilities of events of an entire class s from one and the same sample .
moreover , it is required that the relative frequency of the events converge to the probability uniformly over the entire class of events s .
more precisely , it is required that the probability that the maximum difference ( over the class ) between the relative frequency and the probability exceed a given arbitrarily small positive constant should tend to zero as the number of trials is increased indefinitely .
it turns out that even in the simplest of examples this sort of uniform convergence need not hold .
therefore , one would like to have criteria on the basis of which one could judge whether there is such convergence or not .
this paper first indicates sufficient conditions for such uniform con - vergence which do not depend on the distribution properties and furnishes an estimate for the speed of convergence .
then necessary and sufficient conditions are deduced for the relative frequency to converge uniformly to the probability .
these conditions do depend on the distribution properties .
the main results of the paper were stated in 123
let x be a set of elementary events on which a probability measure px is defined .
let s be a collection of random events , i . e . , of subsets of the space x , which are measurable with respect to the measure px .
let xl ) denote the space of samples in x of size i .
on the space x<l ) we define a probability measure p by
where the y are measurable subsets of x .

we shall be interested in the maximum difference over the class s between relative frequency and probability , namely ,
the quantity rctl is a point function in xt / - space .
we shall assume that this function is measurable with respect to measure in xtl , i . e . , that rttt is a random
if the variable rttl converges in probability to zero as the sample size
is increased indefinitely , then we shall say that the relative frequency of events a s tends ( in probability ) to the probability of these events uniformly over the class s .
the subsequent theorems are devoted to estimates for the probability of the events ( rt / ) > e ) and to a clarification of conditions under which , for any e ,

let x - x t , . . . , x be a finite sample of elements in x .
each set a in s determines in this sample a subsample xff x , . . . , x consisting of those terms of the sample x which belong to a .
we shall say that the set a induces the subsample x in the sample x .
we denote the set of all different subsamples induced by the sets of s in the sample x by s ( x , . . . , x ) or s ( x ) .
the number of different subsamples of the sample x induced by the sets in s will be termed the index of the system s with respect to the sample x , . . . , x and will be denoted by as ( x , . . . , x ) .
obviously , as ( x ,
x ) is always at most 123
the function
where the maximum is taken over all samples of size r , will be called the

let x be a straight line and let s be the set of all rays of
the form x =< a .
in this case , ms ( r )

x is the segment ( 123 , 123 ) .
s consists of all open sets .
in this
let us examine the following example which is important in the subse -
exaei 123
e , , euclidean n - space .
the set s of events consists of all half - spaces of the form ( x , qg ) >_ 123 , where q123 is a fixed vector .
let us evaluate the growth function ms ( r ) .
consider along with the space e , of vectors x , the space e , of vectors
to each vector x e , , there corresponds a partition of the space e , into
vapnik and a .

the half - space ( xk , q123 ) vector q determines some event in the system s .
123 and the half - space ( xk , q ) ) < 123
conversely , each
consider r vectors x a , . . . , x , .
they furnish a partition of e , into a number of components such that the vectors 123 inside each component determine events a e s that induce one and the same subsample in the sample
let @ ( n , r ) be the maximum number of components into which it is
possible to partition n - dimensional space by means of r hyperplanes .
by definition , ms ( r ) o ( n , r ) =o ( n , r - 123 ) +o ( n - 123 , r - 123 ) , ( o , r ) = l ,
in what follows essential use will be made of the function o ( n , r ) .
@ ( n , r ) .
the following recurrence relation holds "
it is not hard to show that
throughout the following , we take ( 123 , ) 123
properties of the growth fnetion .
the growth function for a class of events s has the following property " it is either identically equal to 123 or is majorized by the power function r " + 123 , where n is a constant equaling the value of r for which the equality ms ( r ) 123 " is violated for the first time .
to prove this fact , we need a lemma .
123 if n < k .
lemma 123
iffor some sample of size
xi and number n , 123 <= n <= i ,
then there exists a subsample x ,
x ) >= o ( n , i ) , x , of this sample such that
gp ( n , i ) is defined by the recurrence relation ( 123 ) .
we shall prove the lemma by induction
123 , as well as i , the statement of the lemma easily follows from the definition of the index as ( x , . . . , x ) and the fact that , for assume now that the lemma holds for all < r and n < but is false for x , . . . , x and a number
in other words , let there exist a sample x ,
=> 123 , ( 123 , i ) __> 123 and ( i ) ( i , i )
n < r such that and yet the relation as ( xg , , . . . , x . ) 123 " does not hold for any subsample of size n .
then this relation certainly does not hold for each subsample of size n of the sample x , _ valid for the sample x , _ and hence
x , . - . , x , _ .
but , by assumption , the lemma is
xr - 123 ) < ( i ) ( n , r
uniform convergence of relativefrequencies
further , all subsamples induced by the sets in s in the sample x , _ may be split into two types .
to the first type belongs every subsample t induced by s in x_ such that only one of the subsamples is induced in the whole sample x : either t or t , x , .
to the second belong those t for which both t and t , x are induced in the whole sample .
correspondingly , the set s is partitioned into two subsets : the subset s which induces subsamples of the first type and the subset s " which induces subsamples of the second type .
let a be the number of elements in the set of subsamples of the first type and b the number of elements in the set of subsamples of the second type .
then the following relations hold :
x , _a ) = a + b , x , ) = a + 123b .
xr ) < ( i ) ( n , r
taking ( 123 ) - ( 123 ) into consideration , we have let us now estimate the quantity as " ( xa , . . . , x , _ ) that there exists no subsample xj , . . . , x . _ of the sample xx , . . . , x , _ equation ( 123 ) is impossible since if it were valid , so would the equation
123 ) + b .
to this end , observe
be valid .
the latter is impossible by virtue of the assumption made at the outset of the proof of the lemma
as " ( x , . . . , x , _ ) < 123 " -
for any subsample of x , _ of size n
but the lemma holds for the sample x , _ and hence
x , _ , ) < ( n
substituting ( 123 ) into ( 123 ) , we obtain
as ( xl , " , x , ) < r ( n , r - 123 ) + ( n
123 , r - 123 ) .
using ( 123 ) , we have as ( x , ) < ( n , r ) .
this inequality contradicts assumption ( 123 ) .
the resultant contradiction thus proves the lemma .
theorem 123
the growth function ms ( r ) is either identically equal to 123 or else is majorized by the power function r " + 123 , where n is a positive constant equaling the value of r for which the equation
is violated for the first time .

as already mentioned , ms ( r ) _< 123
suppose ms ( r ) is not identically
equal to 123 and suppose n is the first value of r for which ms ( r ) for any sample of size r > n ,

otherwise , on the basis ofthe statement ofthe lemma , a subsample x , . . . , could be found such that 123 " .
thus ms ( r ) is either but ( 123 ) is impossible , since by assumption ms ( n ) identically equal to 123 " or else is majorized by ( i ) ( n , r ) .
in turn , for r > 123 , ( n , r ) ( x , . . . , x , x+ , . . . , x123 ) and suppose the relative frequencies of the event a s have been calculated in the first semi - sample x , . - . , x x and the second semi - sample x+ : , . . . , x123 x ( .

throughout the following we shall assume that 123 as , then so does p " ) is a measurable function .
in this subsection , we shall show that if p ) 123 and that the estimates for p " ) lead to estimates for it is convenient to introduce the following notation "

lemma 123

by definition ,
taking into account that x ( 123 / ) is the direct product x ( ) x x " ( ) , where x " ) is the space of the first semi - samples xt and x tl ) the space of the second semi - samples x , we have by fubinis theorem that
uniform convergence ofrelativefrequencies
replacing the integration over the whole space xt ( 123 ) by integration over the event q , we obtain
p ( c ) >= fedp
o ( pt ) ) dp .
by definition , to each fixed semi - sample x belonging to q , there exists an event ao s such that ipao - vol > e .
thus , to satisfy the condition 123 l ) > 123 / 123 or , equivalently , the condition ivao v ) o ( > e / 123 , we merely have to require that vo
coming back to inequality ( 123 ) , we estimate the inner integral obtaining
paol <= el123
the right - hand side of this last inequality stands for the probability that the difference between the relative frequency and the probability of a fixed event does not exceed 123 / 123e , i . e . ,
by chebyshevs inequality applied to the binomial distribution ,

from this it immediately follows that , for
the lemma is proved .

sufficient conditions for uniform convergence theorem 123
the probability that the relative frequency of at least one
event in class s differs from its probability in an experiment of size then e , for

corollary .
a sufficient condition for the relative frequencies of events in class s to converge uniformly over s ( in probability ) to their corresponding probabilities is that there exist a finite n such that ms ( l ) <_ l " + 123 for all i .

by virtue of lemma 123 , it suffices to estimate
where p " ) is viewed as a function of the sequence
consider the mapping of the space xt123 ) onto itself resulting from some permutation t of the elements of the sequence x123
by virtue of the symmetry of the definition of the measure p on xt123 ) , the following relation holds for any integrable function f ( x123 )
where the summation is over all ( 123 ! permutations .
observe further that
clearly , if two sets a and a 123 induce the same subsample in a sample

and hence , p ) ( tx123 , ) if we choose the subsystem s essentially different subsamples in the sample x123 , then

by virtue of lemma 123 , this yields

it is easy to see that it is equal to

where m is the number of elements in the sample x x , . . . , x123 belonging to a .
this expression satisfies the estimate f _<_ 123 e - / 123
this estimate can be derived by a simple but long computation and so we omit the proof .

substituting this estimate in the integral ( 123 ) , we obtain
to complete the proof , it remains for us to observe that ms ( 123 ) < ( 123 / ) " + 123 ,

the resultant sufficient condition does not depend on the distribution
on uniform convergence with probability one and estimation of the sample size .
in the preceding subsection , we gave sufficient conditions for the relative frequencies to converge uniformly over the class of events s to the probabilities .
in this subsection , we shall show that the resultant conditions assure uniform convergence almost surely .
in proving this , we make use of the following well - known lemma of probability theory ( cf

as in example 123 of subsection 123 , let x be the real line , - oe < x < oe .
the set s is given by all rays of the form

as was shown , in this case ms ( l )
holds with probability one
( x < a ) ,
in this notation , the fact that there is uniform convergence with probability one may be written in the form
p ( sup if , ( a ) - f ( a ) (
this formula makes up the content of glivenkos theorem ( cf
in a similar way , we can satisfy ourselves that uniform convergence with probability one also holds for the class of events considered in example 123 of subsection 123
the class of events considered in example 123 does not satisfy the sufficient
in many applications , it is important to know what the sample size must be in order that , with probability at least ( 123 - r / ) , one could assert that the relative frequencies differ from their corresponding probabilities by an amount less than e simultaneously over the entire class of events .
in other words , beginning with what value l , does the following inequality

it is possible to show that this inequality holds when

from the properties of expectation and the fact that e ( / )

this in conjunction with lemma 123 and ( 123 ) implies that

the lemma is proved .

indeed , we shall show that from a lower estimate for the probability of event c will follow a lower estimate for p ( q ) .
suppose that x , . . . , x123 is a given sample and that the event q does not occur on both semi - samples , i . e . ,

in what follows , we shall assume that l>_ 123 / q .
thus ( ql ) >= 123 / 123ql .
applying stirlings formula , we obtain the estimate

the partition r is completely prescribed if the partition nk of the subsample y and the partition mj of the subsample x123 y are given .
let r nkmj .
let r ( k ) be the number of elements in the subsample y which belong , under the partition nk , to the first semi - sample and s ( j ) the number of elements of subsample x123i y which belong , under partition m , to the first semi - sample .
clearly , r ( k ) + s ( j ) for k and j corresponding to the same partition r .

for each nk , we can specify a set a ( k ) s such that a ( k ) includes exactly the elements of subsample y which belong under partition nk to the first semi - sample .
introduce the notation " t ( k ) is the number of elements in subsample x123 - y belonging to a ( k ) , u ( k , j ) is the number of elements in x123 - y in a ( k ) belonging , under partition m , to the first semi - sample .

we further take into account that supass pa >= pa ( k ) and replacing supas pn by pa ( k ) we estimate z to obtain

using these relations , we obtain

the expression in the last sum is nothing else than the probability of drawing u black balls from an urn containing 123 - ( 123ql ) balls of which t are black , assuming that l - r balls altogether are drawn without replacement .
moreover ( cf
now applying chebyshevs inequality , we obtain
